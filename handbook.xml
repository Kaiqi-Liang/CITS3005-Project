    <ns1:description>This unit offers students an inspirational history of the ways in which different cultures throughout history have constructed different interpretations of nature and accordingly their relations to it. It examines the ways in which nature has been constructed mythically, theologically, ideologically, philosophically, scientifically and artistically. The unit prepares students intellectually for the environmental and related philosophical challenges of the twenty-first century which will impact upon all professions. The unit covers various strands of Western and Eastern history including topics such as the agricultural revolution, the development of the first cities, the middle ages, the Renaissance, modernity and twentieth-century developments in the sciences and arts. Along the way students meet many of the great figures of history and become conversant with the big ideas of history. The latter stages of the unit concern how our current actions are connected to historical ideas and have consequences for the future.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Psychological Science in the Modern World</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Real-world problems can benefit greatly from applying psychological research to their solutions. Yet policymakers have not always made use of this research and psychologists have not always communicated it in a usable form. This results in less effective solutions and under-utilised research.
This unit consists of an exploration of how psychological theories, methods, and evidence can be used to assist in understanding and solving contemporary social problems. It is also designed to enable students to develop the skills necessary to present this information to policymakers.
The unit introduces students to some of the major social problems in contemporary society. The topics vary from year to year as key issues and debates in society and in the field of psychology change but may include climate change, gender inequality, social conflict, and educational disadvantage. In addition to lectures on these modern social problems, students are also be encouraged to identify and explore some real-world problems that interest them through the tutorials and assignments.
The unit prepares students for further research in psychology with an applied focus, and for employment in organisations - including business, government and the non-government sector - whose work requires the application of psychology to policy development. It will also ensure that students understand the limits of such research. Although a lot is now known about human behaviour from fundamental, often laboratory-based research, there is still relatively little evidence about how these research findings can actually be applied to influence the behaviour of communities and populations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is offered in two parts, which may be taken either concurrently (18 credit points in one semester), or consecutively over two semesters (6 credit points in one semester and 12 points in the next semester). Both parts must be completed in order to achieve a mark for the units.
The unit allows students to develop research skills and comprises a research project in the field of architecture. Research topics may be in either critical studies, design or technical studies, and are to be agreed on between the student and a nominated supervisor and approved by the unit coordinator. Students may have the opportunity to develop topics in association with industry partners or mentors. The Independent Research unit aims to train and assess students' abilities to contribute to the future development of their discipline through research that extends existing knowledge and/or through the creative application of knowledge in ways likely to impact upon future thinking in their fields of study. Study is based on independent research rather than taught coursework and the learning and assessment practices intentionally parallel those of postgraduate research studies.
Independent Research requires the development and demonstration of ability and acquired competence. It is expected that, in addition to addressing a project brief, students establish theoretical parameters  that form the basis for investigation. While projects may vary in scale, and exhibit varying levels of complexity, students are required to incorporate the full range of knowledge and skills required for a fully resolved proposition or dissertation. Projects of an experimental nature are encouraged.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit offers a broad based introduction to postgraduate public health studies. It covers the theoretical underpinnings and applied academic disciplines of public health. It provides a multidisciplinary grounding in public health theory and practice that draws on subject matter from relevant disciplines providing an integrated view of public health. In addition to exploring the origins and development of public health, the unit examines the measurement of population health, major public health challenges in developed and developing countries, and the diverse social, economic, political and environmental conditions that influence the public's health. The unit also explores ethics, social justice and equity issues in public health. Examples of public health research and translation are presented, and learning approaches are tailored, to facilitate an integrated view of public health structure and function, health planning and programs.
Students will achieve transdisciplinary grounding in public health theory and practice, and gain substantial breadth and depth of understanding to appreciate the links between public health history, structure and function; and develop skills in working collaboratively and for critical analysis and scientific writing in public health. Students will have the opportunity to critically consider some key issues in public health with their peers and hear from and engage with a range of experts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This 24-point dissertation unit represents the equivalent of one semester of full-time study. It involves original research by the student under supervision. The dissertation gives students practice and experience in defining a clear research question, preparing a formal research proposal, conducting a review of a body of scientific literature and formal writing at a professional standard. Some dissertation projects involve detailed statistical or qualitative analysis and interpretation of a body of data. Students may collect original data specifically for the research or may analyse existing data in an original manner. Other dissertation projects are based on the analysis of published documents such as policies relating to a particular aspect of public health. Students undertaking such a dissertation are expected to collate, integrate and appraise critically the relevant literature, and evaluate current practice and policy in light of the literature. Other methods of enquiry may also be permitted. Students are encouraged to choose their own topics. Projects relevant to their work may be suitable. Students are also encouraged to undertake projects that are suitable for publication in the professional literature, though this is not a requirement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>What factors have shaped human dealings with the natural world? How have people changed the environment? And how have different societies responded to environmental change over time? These are the questions at the heart of this unit, which offers an introduction to the flourishing field of environmental history. Workshops focus on lively historical debates around topics including Indigenous environmental impacts, human–animal relations, the causes of the American dust bowl, the management of fisheries, the cultural significance of wilderness, the 'green' policies of Nazi Germany, and the politics of climate change. Students gain an understanding of the myriad factors shaping relationships between people and environments in the past; an understanding that is essential for interpreting the environmental problems we face today.</ns1:description>

It is designed to expand students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to film, specialist texts and popular literature. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic and academic Indonesia. Students read a major novel in Indonesian as well as study Indonesian films in detail. The exposure to Indonesian popular media provide students with a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Central to the unit is a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. An in-depth look at a popular film provides a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. The film also provides a springboard into several issues and debates that are explored in class. Students are able to demonstrate 'vocational proficiency' or Level 4 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is an introduction to important concepts in semantics, and provides the necessary basis to understand current areas of research in the discipline. Semantics is the branch of linguistics dedicated to the study of meaning in natural language (NL), and is concerned with the representation of meaning at the lexical, phrasal and sentential levels. When we use language, the meaning we convey is contributed to by a range of factors. Semantics is chiefly concerned with literal meaning, and describes the relations between words and expressions to the real world. The unit mainly concerns denotational, truth-functional theories of meaning and covers topics such as the semantics of noun phrases and verb phrases, as well as key concepts such as language and metalanguage and a range of phenomena including ambiguity, vagueness and presupposition.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Most of us experience the policy process post hoc. It is something done to us, by rich elites, shady politicians, and faceless bureaucrats. It often feels remote and obscure, even threatening. This unit aims to demystify public policy by examining the way that policy is made in contemporary societies. We start from the position that public policy is like any other human activity: it is the product of interests, conflicts, alliances, and inequalities between people. By the end of this unit you will be able understand and analyse these relationships at an advanced level. 
The unit adopts the theory of fields in order to make sense of the wealth of materials, theories, and case studies published on public policy. We will explore policy making through key theories in the study of public policy and profiling the key ‘players' in the game of public policy, paying particular attention to their strategies and interests. The unit is will also offer a detailed case study on a particular struggle within policy making – the appropriate place of evidence in policy. In sum, this unit provides you with the analytical tools to conceptualise and critique the specific figurations that produce ‘policy'.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the construction of Muslim identities in western liberal societies and the importance for these identities of the different interactions between Islamic home countries and western societies. It looks at the presence of Muslims in western societies in terms of an action–reaction phenomenon in which different outlooks, ideas, institutions and nodes of information and authenticity interact to create an environment in which identities are shaped. The unit aims to provide an understanding of the nature of relations between Islam and western societies with particular reference to the effects of phenomena of inclusion and exclusion on the construction of Muslim identities in western liberal democracies.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers digital currencies, blockchains, cryptographic tokens, and related topics in the FinTech area, perhaps the most significant innovation in the financial world in the past century. The technology appears to represent an existential challenge for major parts of the finance industry.
The unit begins with a study of the nature of money and legacy payment and banking systems. Students then study the emergence of stateless, decentralized, cloud-based digital currency systems since 2009, and follow-on investment products, derivatives, and innovations such as initial coin offerings and the extension of cryptocurrency-based technology into securities issuance and trading.
Seminars will explore threats that blockchain technology poses to incumbent firms and even to central banks, and their resulting attempts to co-opt the technology into existing business models. There will also be discussion of related issues including ethical considerations, hacking, “smart contracts,” governance, investment risk and return, and emerging regulatory approaches.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice III Part 2</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the third-year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease and implant treatment. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics and Implant   Clinics.  Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam (with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:
clinical assesssment (ongoing) (50%)
case presentation (30%)
clinical logbook (20%)</ns1:description>

This unit provides students with an advanced capstone experience covering the relationships between science and technology and the larger world they shape, especially (but not only) for students enrolled in the Science and Technology Studies major.
Upon completion of this unit, students know how scientific knowledge is made and understand the diverse contexts in which this knowledge is applied and translated to achieve social goals. They have high levels of critical science literacy, enabling them to address complex challenges at the interface between science, technology, and an increasingly connected world.  Special attention will be paid to the biosciences and biotechnology, broadly construed, and the social and historical contexts in which they have been developed and applied.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The Art of Photography</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>From Degas' selfies to Warhol's serials, photography has reshaped artistic practice since the nineteenth century.  This unit investigates how artists have deployed photography as an observational tool and expressive medium since the first creation of the fixed image.  By analysing a diverse range of global photographic practices from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day, the unit charts how the photograph changed the artistic discourse surrounding mimesis and visual representation.  The history of photography reveals a persistent debate concerning the truth-value of the photographic image, and this unit examines how artists have explored and challenged the idea of the photograph as a form of documentary evidence.  The photograph is much more than a mechanical capture of a moment, and this class considers how artists construct, manipulate, and market photographs as forms of representation.  In the photographic realm, what differentiates an artist from an amateur?  What is the role of artifice in the art photograph?  How has photography responded to and changed the global art market?  Through exposure to a wide range of photographic methods and artists, students learn how art historians critically discuss, contextualise and analyse photographs.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides a critical overview of key theoretical perspectives informing contemporary practice models in child abuse and child protection, and a critical assessment of the Australian context of social, political and cultural contexts of practice. There is a focus on Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing and how they influence a Euro-centric child protection system. Students apply and evaluate theoretical knowledge and skills for practice with parents, children and communities with particular regard to role, purpose, assessment, decision making. The importance of a relationship-based approach is highlighted along with the exploration of ethical frameworks and how the voices of service users is integrated into practice. This unit tackles uncomfortable and contentious issues and offers an opportunity to consider disruptive elements to change the system and child protection practice.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Human-wildlife conflict in the Tropics</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit will examine human-wildlife conflict in Sri Lanka.  This is a 2 week field project in close collaboration with Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.  
Students will learn about the competing economic and conservation aims and land use in Sri Lanka, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.  There are two main agricultural activities, small scale village gardens and large scale commercial tea plantations.  Both replace natural forests, the first human-wildlife conflict. Gardens are raided by wildlife, especially monkeys and elephants, creating the second human-wildlife conflict.  The wildlife is valued by the tourism industry, creating a third conflict between agriculture and tourism.   
UWA students will visit to government departments (National Parks, Forest), industry (tea plantations, village gardens) and NGOs, with suitable work related learning in field situations.  Where possible, UWA students may work SUSL students in classes and research projects.  Learning outcomes will include a wider and deeper understanding of conversation and development issues, and a greater appreciation of Sri Lankan culture, and rebuilding after a long civil war.
UWA students will compare aspects of human-wildlife conflict in Sri Lanka with those present in Australia.  The wildlife species, agricultural systems and culture differ, yet the problems are similar.  This unit will allow the students to broaden their experience of a widespread issue across the world</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice II Part 2</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the second-year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease and implant treatment. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics and Implant   Clinics.  Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam (with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:
clinical assesssment (ongoing) (50%)
case presentation (30%)
clinical logbook (20%)</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Global Literatures</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Literature today exists in a global framework. Contemporary literature has responded to the challenge of globalisation with an extraordinary diversity of imaginative texts. This unit is designed to expose students to a range of literature from across the world and provide the intellectual equipment for dealing with the complexities that arise in reading literature in a transcultural context. As well as coming from different parts of the world, the texts are chosen for the way they represent the implications of a globalised world. Issues that feature in the unit include the movement of people across borders, the forces of global capitalism, the threat to local cultures, the influence of mass and new media, and the history of colonialism.
The aim of the unit is for students to develop a sense of the globalised world as it appears in literature.  At the same time, students are encouraged to apprehend the determining effect that globalisation is having on literature. The unit also serves as an introduction, more generally, to the discipline of literary studies and its key techniques of reading closely as well as contextually.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>A thorough understanding of jurisdiction is vital before commencing proceedings in any court. Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution and Commonwealth legislation enacted pursuant to Chapter III vests federal jurisdiction in courts and, in so doing, grants courts with the relevant authority to decide a ‘matter'. This unit will focus on the history of federal jurisdiction, the key concepts necessary for a working understanding of federal jurisdiction and the significance of its operation within the Australian federation. Students will acquire a practical understanding of how federal jurisdiction operates by analysing a range of High Court decisions and case studies.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Spatial Statistics and Modelling</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Spatial data, information collected from spatial locations, demands high-level statistical methodology to explore, investigate and make scientific conclusions. Such data arises in a wide range of applied fields such as aerial image processing, astronomy, ecology, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, forestry, mineral prospecting, spatial economics and transportation. Spatial dtatistics, the statistical basis for spatial data science, encompasses statistical analysis of three different types of spatial data: geostatistical data, lattice data and point pattern data. Modeling of these different types of data requires different probabilistic and statistical tools. 
This unit begins with a basic introduction to the three types of spatial data and develops some of the statistical tools required to describe and model such data. Then it moves on to in-depth study of a number of topics from the list: spatial stochastic processes, one and higher dimensional point processes, random fields, spatial covariance, variograms, stationarity and non-stationarity, kriging and spatial interpolation, first- and second-order intensity functions, summary functions, spatial models and estimation theory, simulation, spatial regression, spatio-temporal modeling, Bayesian methods in spatial statistics, and analysis of events on linear networks. 
The unit will cover real world examples from many different fields. For statistical analysis and simulation the freeware package R will be used.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit considers the global context of employment relations by examining how global integration has reshaped the role of the state, employers, labour organisations, the status of citizens (or workers) and the character of work. These general themes are further explored with reference to how employment relations practices and institutions are shaped by global investment, production networks, civil society organisations and transnational regulatory institutions. The significance of economic and social context (international institutional variation) will be examined, inclusive of employment relations in developing society contexts. The unit will also examine the influence of multinational corporations on employment relations and the contemporary challenges of international human resource management. The unit introduces students to theoretical frameworks to help them analyse current trends and developments, as well as develop a broad knowledge of contemporary global employment relations practices.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is focused primarily on the role of the pharmacist as a healthcare professional, applying knowledge about disease processes and their management to the delivery of health care to the community. It includes consideration of the relationship of the pharmacist with other health professionals. Detailed consideration is made of the medication review process through case studies and interacting with patients, including coverage of the issues of client counselling, consent, confidentiality and compliance. 
The ethics surrounding pharmacy practice is revisited using the experience gained during the pharmacy placements as a framework for discussion. Following on from previous units, the dispensing practice and use of miscellaneous preparations, including therapeutic devices, are considered in depth. New and emerging professional services are covered, highlighting the importance of continuing education and professional goal setting.
While the unit focuses on specific areas, students are expected to be conversant with all material covered in the program to date and this cumulative knowledge may be included in assessments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In the period 1250 to 1788 rich and powerful societies in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas increasingly came into contact and conflict. This unit investigates the comparative histories of these societies, exploring themes such as the changing views of the world from Islamic and European perspectives, the range and effects of major demographic events such as the Black Death 'pandemic' of 1345 to 1351, religious proselytisation, the economic bases of different societies, and the beginnings of European colonisation, up to the 'discovery' of Australia. Through analysing these themes, students are given the opportunity to develop critical reading, research and written and oral communication skills. Within the context of the progressive development of historical skills required by the History major, the unit introduces students to the elementary principles of historical knowledge.
The unit aims to produce students who can critically analyse and understand (1) how the world was viewed by people at different times and places in the period 1250 to 1788; (2) how agrarian economies and class structures worked in different parts of the pre-modern world; (3) the effect of disease on world history; (4) what different political structures arose in different parts of the world, and why, during this period; (5) how religious conversion and imperialism operated globally in this period; and (6) colonialism and its implications for ethnic relations, gender relations and slavery.</ns1:description>

Its ambition is to guide and support students experiencing the design process by offering the structure to develop their own design methodology, underpinned by a strong research base and an eloquent and critical architectural literacy.
Students select from a range of autonomous studios each structured as an exploration through architectural design. The studios are vertically integrated to offer a wide range of choice of project types and inter-level peer learning. The focus will range from formal briefs and competitions to themes informed by research expertise and practice. These typically require the design of medium to large-scale architectural propositions with complex constraints and requirements of research informed experimental projects.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Teaching Performance Assessment</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The Assessment for Graduate Teaching (AfGT) is an approved Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA) instrument, endorsed by The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL), which was developed and implemented by a consortium of Australian higher education providers that have Initial Teacher Education (ITE) faculties or schools. The AfGT is designed to capture the sophisticated intellectual work of teaching and enable pre-service teachers to demonstrate the various ways in which they can meet the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (Graduate level). The AfGT has been developed as a final-year teaching performance assessment prior to graduation to:
a) be a reflection of classroom teaching practice including the elements of planning, teaching, assessing and reflecting
b) be a valid assessment of the Graduate Teacher Standards
c) have clear, measurable and justifiable achievement criteria that discriminate between meeting and not meeting the Graduate Teacher Standards
d) include moderation processes that support consistent decision-making against the achievement criteria.
The summative, capstone nature of the AfGT implies that it is dependent upon successful completion of all other units comprising the pre- service teacher's initial teacher education (ITE) program. This includes the successful completion of the final professional experience placement.
(NB: This is a PASS/FAIL unit. If there is just the AfGT as the one assessment, a case will need to be made for exemption to policy.  Base content on the M Teach TPA unit).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides students with the ability to design and undertake health research and thereby contribute to the future development of population health. It provides students with the knowledge, skills and values required to conduct scientific research. It is designed to develop enhanced observational skills, relevant practical research skills, lateral thinking and problem solving, literacy and communication skills, as well as professional responsibility and ethical conduct. It also develops and consolidates students' knowledge and skills acquired during undergraduate study, with particular emphasis on using those skills in a sustained and purposeful way in conducting independent research relevant to population health. 
Honours students participate in original research by the conduct of a supervised research project, a presentation of research findings and preparation of a journal-style scientific manuscript. They also participate in the School of Population and Global Health seminar program. Specifically, students implement a research plan to investigate the research question developed in the unit, collect, manage and analyse their research data using appropriate method, interpret the results and draw conclusions using published evidence and sound scientific arguments, present a research seminar, and prepare a manuscript. Students are required to attend at least 80 per cent of the school seminar program, or equivalent with approval of the honours coordinators. Students maintain a reflective journal of these seminars and identify the key messages of each weekly seminar attended and any relevance to their research. They are encouraged to think laterally about what is relevant to their particular project.
Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Introduction to Roman Private Law</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to Roman private law, which has, for centuries, provided the conceptual foundation for legal science and legal problem-solving in the Western tradition. The unit is grounded in the Institutes of Gaius (second century CE) and the Institutes of Justinian (sixth century CE); the primary materials are studied in translation: no Latin is required. 
While also noticing key concepts from the law of persons and from the law of actions, the unit engages with substantive Roman law in four principal areas: (1) sources; (2) property; (3) contracts; and (4) delicts. An additional theme is the Institutional taxonomy of private law, a reference point for the organisation of all subsequent systems, civilian and common law.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Relational databases are the backbones of modern businesses in processing transactions and storing customer data. Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views. Students study the use of data warehouses through a study of the OLAP technology including the multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP) architectures, OLAP operations and structured query language (SQL) support for OLAP.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The law of unjust enrichment has until recently been the forgotten area of private law or the law of obligations. It is now firmly entrenched as the third fundamental area of the law of obligations, along with contract and tort. This unit focuses on several areas of the law of unjust enrichment including mistaken payments, duress, failure of consideration and available defences. Also dealt with are waiver of tort, estoppel, tracing, and restitutionary recovery of improperly acquired gains. Key areas of the law that are unclear when considered other than in the context of the law of unjust enrichment are also dealt with, for example, unconscionability, waiver of tort, estoppel, and equitable and common law tracing. The unit also examines the law of restitution, the gains based remedy for actions in unjust enrichment and an under-appreciated additional remedy available to other causes of action such as wrongs.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to introduce students to the relevant concepts and principles in economics and business management and analytical tools in making strategic decisions in the agribusiness environment. The unit starts by exploring economic concepts and principles relevant for analysing strategic decisions in perfect competitive markets. The economic fundamentals of strategic management in agribusiness are explored by examining principles that underlie production decisions, the cost structure and profit maximization behaviour of firms. Logistical and organisational issues that affect the size and scope of a firm and how decisions are made along the food value chains are examined. Students are also introduced to research methods in agribusiness.
The goal of this unit is to prepare students for professional endeavours that demand skills in managerial decision making and communication in an agricultural-related environment.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides students marks the completion of the research project and it is expected that most of the work produced by students can be published under the co-authorship of the students. Students also continue to build on concepts of personal and professional development in preparation for clinical practice on graduation.
This unit comprises two modules (1) Research Project and (2) Personal and Professional Development (PPD).
The Research Project Module allows students to understand the process of research and achieve research outcomes by undertaking a research project (commenced in Year 3). Students actively participate, working in a small group as collaborators to research projects supervised by the staff of the School of Dentistry or other schools from this university. The Personal and Professional Development module requires you to attend lectures and case presentations  to discuss issues such as legislation, ethics, risk management, planning a professional path and other related topics. Students integrate the learning content through peer discussions, debates and online lecture content.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Theory II Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the second-year theory unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and  and  part 2  DENT 6840 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the academic year . The unit allows the more advanced application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning.
Teaching Methods: Prescribed readings, seminars, tutorials, discussions, and student
presentations.
Assessment: The assessment in these two semester theory units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are: active participation in seminars and presentations from other registrars and
staff and presentations of assignments (periodontal/implant topics; case presentations and
journal clubs). The assignments (written essay; presentation; journal club and case presentation) should demonstrate original, individual input from the student with critical thinking.
Additional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semester are
DOPS (Direct observation of procedural skills) , CbD (case based discussion) and Mini-CEX (Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise) forms. Although these are mainly used in a clinical setting
they can contribute to assess the Registrar and give immediate feedback on both clinical and theoretical aspects
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with two to three internal examiners will be carried out as
below:
A three hour written exam (40%)
One hour oral exam (40%)
critical appraisal of a scientific article (20%)</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the historiography of National Socialism. It explores two major discussions among historians: (1) How did National Socialism come into existence? Was it the result of a specific German deviation from the natural course of history or the very essence of modernity? (2) How did the horror of the industrialised killing of the Jewish population emerge as one of the central results of Nazi rule over Europe? Was it planned all along by Hitler and his henchmen, or was it the outcome of a cumulative process of radicalisation? Why did so many participate in this genocide and why was there so little resistance against it?</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit builds on the fundamental knowledge and skills gained in the previous years of the DMD course. It is a continuation of the clinical disciplines that were introduced in the Integrated Dental Practice 1 and 2 (IDP 1, IDP 2) units – that is, Periodontics, Endodontics, Restorative Dentistry (including Prosthodontics), Paediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics. In addition, the relevant concepts of general surgery, general anaesthesia, oral medicine, orofacial pain, oral pathology and dento-maxillofacial surgery will be taught. Students will learn to perform tooth extractions, manage post-extraction complications, assess and diagnose oral diseases, and conduct diagnostic tests.
Students will continue to provide clinical dental treatments pursuant to their patient's needs and the individual student's abilities. Students work in the clinics under the supervision of experienced academic and clinical staff. As the Semester progresses, the number and complexity of procedures undertaken will increase. Students will also be rostered to various specialist dental clinics to observe and participate in the management of patients requiring specialist dental treatment. Personal and professional development will continue throughout the Semester and students will continue working on the group research project that was commenced in 2nd Year of the DMD course - this project will continue throughout the remainder of the DMD course.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Applied Statistics and Data Visualisation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Statistical methods are used to analyse data in a wide variety of fields (e.g. engineering, medicine, agriculture, business, economics, psychology, genetics, criminology, the social sciences). Such real world data often present challenges to data scientist and data analysts.  For example, some of the data may be missing, some observations may be inconsistent with the rest of the data, the standard assumptions (e.g. normality) may fail, and the standard methods may not answer the important questions.  While statistical theory can be helpful in analysing such data, its direct application may be limited by these practical problems. The best way to learn how to deal with these practical problems is to gain experience in analysing real data. This unit provides this experience by applying various statistical methods, through case studies and projects, to interesting practical problems rather than concentrating on the theory behind the methods. 
The unit covers applications of a number of widely used statistical techniques selected from advanced regression topics (for example generalised linear models or nonlinear regression models), survival analysis, non-parametric statistics, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis.  Furthermore, throughout the unit a large emphasis is placed on data visualisation techniques.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>More than half the world's people now live in cities, but what role have cities played in the past? This unit explores the dazzling history and heritage of the world's great cities, through themes such as urban culture, environment and planning, gender roles, migration and race relations, as well as rebellion and protest. Among the cities studied may be the medieval and renaissance cities of Europe; the colonial cities of Africa and Asia; the old world cities of London, Paris, and St Petersburg; and the new world cities of North America and Australia. Students are given the opportunity to gain an understanding of the role of cities in world history as sites of population, power and culture, to gain a grounding in historiographical and theoretical trends in urban history, and to design a research project that engages with a major urban historical theme such as race, class, gender, or the culture or environment of a city.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit models and promotes the active learning and teaching of mathematics in middle and upper primary school. Pre-service teachers will explore current evidence-based practices for promoting understanding, fluency, problem solving and reasoning, set within the content strands of number and algebra, measurement and geometry, and statistics and probability, and with a focus on mathematics learning for Years 3–6. Pre-service teachers will continue to develop a portfolio of teaching and learning strategies that actively engage students in working mathematically, and that develop the general capabilities and address the cross-curriculum priorities of the Australian Curriculum. Pre-service teachers will apply their knowledge and skills to prepare a unit of work and a program for teaching a mathematics topic or theme in the middle and upper primary years. Pre-service teachers will work independently and collaboratively to develop their confidence and mathematical skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to allow Level 1 students who have achieved a high level of spoken and written Indonesian through study in school or elsewhere to study Indonesian at UWA. As an unattached elective, this unit does not provide the first step of a pathway to a major in Indonesian. The unit aims to help students to achieve 'social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2+ of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). 
Students explore social, cultural and political issues, both prescribed and of their own choice. This is done through exposure to a wide range of authentic, contemporary Indonesian language material, including fiction, newspapers, radio and TV/film. Students are required to use internet resources to keep themselves up-to-date on the social and political changes taking place in Indonesian society. They develop reading, writing and translation skills in official, colloquial and literary styles. They also participate in conversation classes and are exposed to a variety of recorded material. In addition, they work on language development (structure and grammar), both in a prescribed way and also in response to questions about the texts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Humanity has been extracting marine and aquatic food resources for tens of thousands of years by means of fishing, and these days fishing is the single biggest human impact factor on marine animal populations and marine ecosystems globally, followed by climate change and plastic pollution. The impacts of fishing, be it commercial, recreational or for subsistence, can be felt and seen everywhere in the marine environment, from our coastal systems to the global high seas. Fisheries and their impacts are also a major driving force in the global economy, with seafood now being the most widely traded food commodity in the world. Fisheries also have substantial social implications, ranging from increasing poverty and human migrations in West Africa to the emergence of modern piracy in Somalia and elsewhere. This unit will provide students with a solid grounding in the foundations of fisheries science, and identify features, methods and principles of fisheries science used to inform policy and management of both large and small-scale fisheries around the world. In addition to the scientific foundations and principles around fisheries science, this unit will also provide and discuss a range of applied examples from both global and local West Australian fisheries. Core elements will include the foundation principles of fisheries science, the core data needs in fisheries science, introduction to methods used in assessing fish populations, and their application to fisheries data sets at different scales. Finally, clear links will be made to the growing need to align fisheries science with conservation science and strategies and policies, in order to ensure sustainability of fisheries resources for future generations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This is the second part of the first-year clinical practice unit in Prosthodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. It involves the comprehensive examination, diagnosis and management of patients that have been referred to the OHCWA Specialist Prosthodontics Clinic. Students are supervised during clinical sessions by specialist prosthodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the prosthodontic clinic over the three years of the course. Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training. This logbook is assessed throughout the unit and at the end of the third year of the course by the external examiner(s). The content will introduce all aspects of specialist prosthodontic clinical practice including oral rehabilitation with fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics. Students will learn through clinical management of patients while being supervised by specialist prosthodontists, together with pre-clinical exercises, laboratory work, workshops, and student case presentations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Over recent decades there has been growth in government and an increasing diversification and complexity in government service provision. There has also been, for the most part, a concomitant rise in the number (and reach) of accountability agencies, so much so that some commentators now talk of the emergence of a fourth branch of government, the ‘integrity branch', to sit alongside of the executive, legislature and judiciary. These accountability agencies have responsibility for overseeing, investigating and educating the public sector in relation to matters such as corruption, misconduct, good decision making, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Such agencies play a vital role. Governments make decisions on a daily basis that directly shape many aspects of individual and corporate existence. With such regulation comes the need for transparency, responsibility and accountability. In the words of former Commonwealth Ombudsman Professor John McMillan, "In short, the power of government is pervasive, and accountability is an indispensable check on how that power is exercised."</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Ecological rehabilitation is the science of repairing essential ecosystem structures and functions in environments that have been impacted by industrial, urban, or other disturbances. It does not imply restoration; that is, return of the environment to an identical pre-disturbance state, but instead acknowledges the irreversibility of some environmental changes and seeks to identify the options that deliver the greatest ecological value under these conditions. Ecological rehabilitation integrates scientific expertise from geology, soils, hydrology, botany, zoology, ecology, and social sciences to develop holistic intervention strategies to repair ecosystem structure and function. Students will acquire skills and knowledge in each of these disciplines and use them to assess degradation and formulate intervention strategies for impacted sites.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The study of human structure and development begins with an overview of early development followed by the low-power examination of serial sections through human embryos and fetuses. The aim of this is not to engage in detailed histological or embryological analysis but to build an understanding of the body plan and how it develops. The anatomy of the vertebral column, articular system and the body wall follow. The systemic and regional anatomy of the thorax, abdomen and the pelvis come next.  In each regional study area the embryology is reinforced and the students return to look more closely at each region using fetal serial sections.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Managing the impact of production processes and human consumption of goods and services on the environment without reducing overall welfare is one of the most challenging issues facing society. This unit introduces students to both current and long-standing issues in natural and environmental resource management and policy. First, it presents basic concepts of natural and environmental resource management. Secondly, it examines economics of mining, fisheries and forestry with an extension to economics of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Thirdly, it examines the economics of pollution control. Finally, it explores non-market valuation techniques in relation to the management of environmental and natural resources. In analysing environmental and natural resource management issues, the unit extensively uses various economic models and valuation techniques.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The aim in this unit is to provide students with the capability to select and evaluate the appropriate underground mining method, together with its associated equipment, services and infrastructure, for a given deposit. To achieve this, a systems-approach is implemented to the principles, design and application of the major underground mining methods, such as sublevel stoping, cut-and-fill mining, narrow vein mining, and caving methods.
During the semester, there may be a field trip to some underground mines if the conditions allow it. This trip is likely to last a few days, during the semester study break. Accommodation and food costs are borne by the students, and students must sign a student code of conduct before attending and observe health and safety instructions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces key concepts and methods in the history of architecture and design. It examines how technical, material, cultural, and geographical factors fashioned the ways people build and why they have done so. While including a chronological survey of early modern architecture, the unit makes an adjacent study of specific architectural themes and theories accompanying the political and industrial upheavals that apparently closed the period of the Enlightenment in the West and produced the modern world. Students will investigate such themes and theories by comparing notable case studies that will be researched, documented, and analysed in detail.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Spatial analysts are in high demand across the environment, health, engineering, agriculture, population and policy sectors as they possess the critical skills to use complex spatial data to provide solutions to the big questions facing landscapes, communities and economies. This unit focuses on student learning through practical and applied laboratories and field learning using drones, to support students in developing skills to manipulate, transform, analyse, and visualise big spatial data to provide solutions to a range of multi-disciplinary issues and questions. 
This unit builds from the foundations of using geographic data from GEOG2201 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and focuses on core skills that directly relate to students seeking employment as a GIS / spatial analysts, or those seeking to develop the advanced spatial data handling and analysis skills to work in any disciplines that uses spatial data to address critical and important questions. 
Skills that students will learn in this course include: foundational skills including programming concepts and an introduction to HTTP, automating the conversion of spatial data formats and working with cloud-native and big spatial data formats, assembling time-series datasets for analysis; accessing data and services using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); practical experience using drones to collect multispectral spatial data; big data wrangling, analysis, and visualization techniques; web-mapping; and, applying big spatial datasets to answer complex problems. 
The unit is designed in two parts. Part 1 is an initial program of 8 weeks, which is focused on developing advanced GIS and big-data programming and handling skills, using data from a range of disciplines. This course uses a student-led inquiry style of teaching, where background materials are presented via on-line learning modules and vignettes, and then supported through face-to-face laboratories. In the last 4 weeks, students apply their skills and techniques learned across part 1 of the course, on an applied small research topic of their choosing. The course is suited to students from a range of disciplines.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Evidence</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Evidence is about the adversarial trial which is our society's primary, ultimate mechanism for determining disputed facts for the purpose of assigning legal liability. The study of the rules of evidence is an examination of procedure and substance. The unit looks at a set of rules which determine the process of a trial and which embodies theories of knowledge and morality—How best do we arrive at a truth? How best do we balance truth and fairness? At a trial, two conflicting stories are told and after hearing the stories, a fact-finder (jury, judge or magistrate) must say 'yes' or 'no' to the story told by the prosecution/plaintiff. It matters, in determining that 'yes' or 'no', what information the fact-finder is allowed to hear, what use they are allowed to make of what they hear, and even how sure they need to be in order to say 'yes'. It is the rules of evidence which determine these things. Students learn the major rules of evidence governing a trial in Western Australia and make comparisons with rules from other jurisdictions. They extend skills of case analysis, legal reasoning and statutory interpretation by considering hypothetical scenarios—Is certain evidence admissible? If so, how can it be used and by whom? Is there enough evidence? Can it be countered? Students extend skills of legal reasoning and critical analysis by exploring the concept of a fair trial as it appears in specific principles and underpins the system of evidence rules as a whole.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit consolidates clinical practice in podiatry in preparation for the student to enter independent practice upon graduation and registration as a podiatrist. All aspects of the assessment and treatment of common foot conditions, performing minor surgery and the administration and prescription of scheduled medications are covered. Students should demonstrate critical thinking ability, reflective practice, engage in peer mentorship and learning, and research skills to promote themselves as lifelong learners. Students engage in critical clinical reasoning skills, communication skills, cultural awareness and the ethical principles of patient centered care in practice. Students will also build on essential skills such as a self-directed approach to learning and the ability to work as part of a team, becoming the life long learner, the ethical professional, the educator, the researcher and the patient advocate. Students apply the principles of evidenced-based practice and research in the management of podiatric pathologies, understand and implement strategies for health maintenance, promotion and disease prevention in a range of population sub-groups and demonstrate a professional approach to the management of ethical and legal responsibilities and challenges in podiatric practice. Students will also select and prescribe appropriate scheduled medicines in general and specialist podiatric practice for specified conditions within professional guidelines.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Income Taxation Law</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system. 
The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Over the millennia our understanding of our place in space has changed dramatically. This unit takes students from traditional beliefs across different cultures (with a particular focus on the rich cultural tradition of Australian Aboriginal solar system astronomy) to modern discoveries about the planets, their internal structure and how they were created. Students will learn about the near-space environment of the Earth, and gain an understanding of "space weather" and "space debris" - sometimes referred to as space junk. This will be followed by an introduction to "space law" - which is becoming important for national security and the continuing use of space for commerce, such as mining the Moon and beyond. The last part of the unit focuses on the search for life elsewhere in the solar system, and the search for life-bearing planetary systems and extraterrestrial civilisations and the many missions to explore the Solar System.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an overview of the theoretical approaches to understanding development, and how key concepts have historically been translated into policy and action. The concept of development, how it is achieved, the role of relevant actors, and its impacts remain contested. This unit explores the evolution of these contestations, providing students with an understanding of the key debates surrounding the concepts of development, poverty, underdevelopment, and progress. It considers the role of states, markets, institutions, and non-governmental organisations, and their interrelationships, and the discourse surrounding the measurement and evaluation of development outcomes. The unit provides students with an understanding of recent trends in these debates, such as the origin and impact of 'good governance' agendas, the politics of aid programming and foreign policy, and the evolving role of states and markets in the provision of welfare.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores 'death' in literal and metaphoric senses across all human cultures over the past 3 million years. Indeed, it is how we treat 'death' that is one of the defining characteristics of being human. Death can also include 'objects' held to be living in certain Indigenous knowledge systems. This unit describes the skills archaeologists and forensic analysts need, such as: awareness of the ethics, legislation, occupational health and safety and culturally-appropriate protocols in studying death. There is also technical expertise in identifying, recording and interpreting mortuary contexts, grave goods, and DNA. Topical questions such as whether Neanderthals buried their dead are also addressed. This unit does not address archaeological forensics, which is dealt with in FNSC2200 Mysteries of Forensic Science.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces the concept of property by considering questions regarding 'what is property?' and 'what things are capable of being the object of property rights?' It explains the importance of possession in property law and considers this in the context of real and personal property. It identifies and explains fundamental principles of land law including the physical dimensions of real property; the doctrine of tenure and estates; and First Nation peoples' rights to land at common law. Students also explore the different ways in which proprietary interests in real and personal property may be created and transferred including by consent; without consent and by the operation of general equitable principles. The unit concludes with an examination of the priority rules to resolve disputes between competing interests in land and the law of co-ownership. The unit fosters a critical and analytical approach to examining property law principles. Where appropriate, it explores the social, political, economic and historical context of, and the ethical issues that arise in, property law. Students advance the core legal skills of problem solving; statutory interpretation; effective oral communication skills; and clear, concise and persuasive written legal arguments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit students will be supported in developing their skills in podiatric treatments, therapy, intervention techniques and patient management in individuals and those requiring advanced foot and ankle surgery. This unit develops a patient-centred approach to the investigation and an introduction to the surgical management of common foot pathologies of the forefoot, mid-foot and rearfoot. Students undertake advanced tuition in the selection of elective podiatric surgical procedures, the principles of internal fixation and post-operative care of the surgical patient. The diagnosis and management of post-operative complications is considered in a multidisciplinary context including assessment of relevant body systems..  Topics covered in the general podiatric surgery component include the principles of general surgery, disturbances of homeostasis, wound healing, care of the surgical patient, complications of surgery including bleeding and infection and wound healing and explain the role of podiatrist, podiatric surgeon &amp; surgical assistant while identifying the . Emergencies in practice including anaesthetic trauma, emergencies, first aid, resuscitation, recovery from anaesthesia are discussed. The anaesthesia component covers areas relevant to podiatric practice including  the use by podiatrists of local anaesthetics, 'conscious sedation' techniques and sedative agents are covered in detail.  Students develop a deep application of their professional requirements to demonstrate and assure safe practice including referencing; relevant regulatory and ethical resources, antimicrobial stewardship, the Quality Use of Medicines (QUMs), the National Prescribing Standards (NPS), the National Strategy for Quality Use of Medicines(NSQHS), the Therapeutic Guidelines, Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH), Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers concepts relating to measurement and noise, enabling students to understand the issues required to achieve high-quality measurements. Topics include accuracy, precision, repeatability, calibration, uncertainty and signal noise. Measurements from a range of sensors (mechanical, optical, electrical) are introduced and subsequent signal conditioning (operational amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers) are addressed with the aim of maximising signal quality. Statistical methods are discussed to better understand noise processes and how signal noise can be minimised. Methods to improve signal quality (signal to noise ratio) are discussed. Measurement signal and noise are analysed in both the time and frequency domain to better understand the connection between two domains and the importance of measurement bandwidth. Sampling is reviewed to understand the impact of moving from continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT), including discussion of the Nyquist rate and aliasing. The conversion between the analogue to digital domains including CT-DT, system transfer functions, spectral analysis (discrete Fourier transform, discrete-time Fourier transform) and the construction of finite and infinite impulse response filters to reduce noise is discussed.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit highlights the importance of financial literacy in personal financial decision making. It reflects the increased financial responsibility that students face in areas including debt accumulation, financial product selection and retirement savings decisions. Students explore a range of topics including the impact of behavioural biases that are a natural part of decision making, with a view to exploring the impact these biases can have on financial decisions. Students are introduced to time value of money, with examples of the dramatic impact of compounding on both debt and equity. This introduction includes analysis of the cost of credit card debt, loans and mobile phone contracts. Students critique the concept of human capital, with a view to identifying their own human capital and understanding the part that education plays in creating this capital. They explore the interaction between consumption smoothing, debt and investing, along with planning for retirement within the present Australian superannuation system. Students create their own personal balance sheet and a simple plan for their financial future and write a reflective journal concerning this task as part of the unit.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit considers in detail the Torrens System of land title registration including (1) the concept of indefeasibility of title; (2) the exceptions to indefeasibility; and (3) the nature and role of caveats and unregistered interests in the Torrens System. It explores the law regarding land transactions including mortgages, leases and easements. The unit fosters a critical and analytical approach to examining land law principles which are revealed in the case readings and in legislation. It identifies, where appropriate, ethical issues that arise in land law. It seeks to advance the core legal skills of problem solving; statutory interpretation; effective oral communication skills; and clear, concise and persuasive written legal arguments. The assessment seeks to examine these core legal skills and further provides students with the opportunity to hone their skills in case law analysis; statutory interpretation and independent learning. In addition, students participate in a reflective feedback exercise in which students are asked to reflect on an item of assessment submitted in the first semester property unit [LAWS4104 Property (formerly LAWS5104 Property)].</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers some fundamental issues which are central in philosophy and which provide an introduction to contemporary philosophical debate. The topics are organised around three major themes—God, Mind and Knowledge. It covers such issues as whether it is reasonable to believe in God, whether we have grounds for believing in the external world, whether the mind and brain are really distinct and what makes us count as the same person over time.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Marketing is everywhere. It is built on the premise that organisational, business, and even personal success comes through understanding the needs and perspectives of others, and through communicating with others based on this understanding.
In organisations, commercial and non-commercial, large and small, marketing is the function that links the organisation to the external environment. First, marketing is responsible for gathering and analysing data from many sources, such as social media. Then, based on this market research, marketing is responsible for developing products and services for many different customers, and then promoting these offerings in many ways, such as search engines.
All organisations carry out marketing. You even have to market yourself! In this unit, students are introduced to a range of marketing topics, hopefully creating an interest to learn more in the specific marketing major units in following years.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit develops the interdisciplinary communication and problem-solving skills needed by a quantitative professional, such as a professional statistical consultant or a quantitative researcher working as part of a multidisciplinary research team. The main aims are to expose students to the types of challenges in communication and in problem solving that typically arise in this professional context, and to equip students with basic strategies and skills for interdisciplinary communication and problem solving. Interdisciplinary communication skills include written and oral communication in technical and non-technical language and in formal or informal presentations, interpersonal and presentational skills, and ethical awareness. Problem solving is a process that involves acquiring an understanding of the problem, identifying and clarifying the essential parts of the problem, reformulating the problem in a quantitative setting, making strategic and tactical decisions about handling the problem, tackling the technical core of the problem, translating the results back to the original context, and presenting the results in a comprehensible manner to the client. The unit covers all phases of the problem-solving process, giving strategies for each phase.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to moral philosophy, and considers its application to problems arising out of the development of new, digital technologies. The first half of the unit covers several influential theories about what makes an action or policy morally right or morally wrong: the divine command theory, moral relativism, utilitarianism, two aspects of Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory, and virtue ethics. In the second half of the unit, applied ethical questions concerning cutting-edge digital technologies are discussed. In the near future, for example, autonomous vehicles will be routinely confronted with the need to make life-or-death decisions. What values should we ‘programme in' to such machines, and how should we decide? Is it possible for a machine to reason morally? How should we manage the risks inherent in the development of new technology? Is there a legitimate role for artificial intelligence in the law? Might sufficiently developed forms of artificial intelligence be said to have a form of consciousness, and might this have implications for how they ought to be treated?</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirement of the unit. Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2.
The academic objectives of the project are to improve students' understanding of the research process and to develop their capability to conduct independent research. The unit allows students to develop their research interests and skills. Students learn about recent advances and gain in-depth technical competence in at least one specialist area of their discipline, apply the basic elements of research design to investigate a theory or hypothesis, and appreciate how research skills support lifelong learning. Students are required to communicate their findings to technical and nontechnical audiences using a range of media. They are also exposed to the University's research culture and opportunities to pursue further study. This project may be credited towards the Master of Professional Engineering (MPE).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In this unit, students will gain a broad foundation in the principles of optics that underpin the practice of optometry, with the use of problem-based learning approach. In studying these topics, students will learn to apply the knowledge, for example, by performing ray traces through optical elements, such as curved surfaces or lenses, and determining the different characteristics of the images formed by these elements. Practical classes will provide the opportunity for the students to observe the ‘real world' effect of the different optical elements of light, whilst also introducing them to working in teams. These principles of optics will provide the necessary basis for higher levels of study relating to ophthalmic dispensing, contact lenses, low vision and eye examination techniques.
Specific topics to be addressed in this unit include:
-	the physical nature of light, colour;
-	basic principles of reflection and refraction;
-	plane and curved mirrors; thin and thick lenses; and
-	mathematical principles that govern ray tracing</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to how the writers, thinkers and artists of ancient Greece and Rome have influenced writers, thinkers and artists worldwide, from Africa in the 5th century CE (Saint Augustine) to contemporary Australia. In the first half of the unit students receive a roadmap of major historical landmarks in the ‘Classical Tradition', such as the revival of classical learning under Charlemagne in the 9th century CE, the Platonic Renaissance of the twelfth century, and the recovery of lost ancient works by the humanists of the Italian Renaissance. In the second half, via a series of in-depth case studies, students will have the opportunity to explore the reception of key ancient works in medieval, early modern and contemporary literature and media. Genres and authors covered may include: epic, from Homer through to Margaret Atwood's Penelopiad; ancient Stoic thought in the Renaissance and in modern self-help literature; and various film adaptations of classical plays, stories and characters, such as Pasolini's Medea and Spike Lee's Chi-Raq (based on Aristophanes' Lysistrata).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to relevant aspects of project management and engineering practice that they need to successfully transition from formal education to professional practice. As the industry becomes increasingly 'project focused', employers are seeking engineers who possess strong project management knowledge, skills and capabilities in line with sustainable principles and ethical standards, to be applied to 'real world projects'. The unit focuses on real world engineering projects and benefits the students significantly by enhancing their capabilities and employability skills. In the unit, students learn to (1) research and analyse a real world engineering project to which key concepts and theories of sustainable and ethical project management are applied—implement a rigorous approach to analysing the project by applying a globally recognised project life cycle framework; (2) identify and analyse the problems encountered in each stage of the project and establish relevant inferences; (3) provide prioritised recommendations based on the benefits and consequences deriving from them; and (4) analyse project stakeholders' input and influence and manage them accordingly. Students enhance their interpersonal skills as they are required to take an active part in group meetings, share group coordination and leadership and learn how to negotiate and solve conflict. Students also liaise with key industry representatives, giving them the opportunity to establish professional relationships.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Plants have literally shaped the Earth and its environment, priming the great oxygenation event several billion years ago which enabled the evolution of all aerobic life. We are sustained by the bountiful plant life around us, but it is their capacity to adapt and acclimate to wide conditions that make studying plants so interesting. This plasticity driven by the plant genome underpins native ecosystems, enables restoration of toxic or nutrient-poor land, as well as the use of plants in managed systems including agriculture. Plants also have a wide range of relationships with other organisms, from food or host to symbiont or parasite. Grain/seed production sustains the energy requirements of the growing human population, as well as being one of the major international commodities traded around the world. Plant metabolic pathways facilitate acclimation to a changing environment and produce compounds (e.g. vitamins) essential for human and animal health. This unit takes students through the parts (organs, tissues and cells) that make up plants, and considers the relationships and influences of plants on the environment and other organisms. Students will gain practical skills in evaluating plant function in the context of many disciplines. Topics include the structure–physiology relationships at the cell, tissue, organ, plant and community levels; plant growth and development; transfer processes in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum; energy capture and metabolism; water relations; nutrient acquisition; and acclimations to the environment.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Power and Politics in the Roman Empire: 44 BC-AD 68</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to Roman history from 44 BC to AD 68, a period which began with the assassination of Julius Caesar and finished with the death of the Emperor Nero. This was a period of profound cultural and political change at Rome and in the wider Mediterranean world, which coincided with the drift towards the establishment of a monarchical system of government at Rome, led by a 'princeps', or 'first citizen'. Moreover, with the completion of Rome's conquest of the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of once independent kingdoms and communities had now to adapt to life under Roman hegemony.  
In addition to charting the major political and administrative developments of the time, the unit also explores the interactions between Romans and the subject peoples of the Empire. The unit aims not only to impart knowledge about this seminal period in world history but also to interpret and explain key features of it.  
The unit offers a carefully structured program of lectures, identifying and tracing the development of the major political, social and cultural aspects of the ancient Julio-Claudian period, and a complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments that examine some of these aspects in depth. Tutorial participation is a vital part of the learning process and in the development of reasoning and analytical skills. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material and a written in-class assignment and tutorial discussion of this assignment deals specifically with this crucial aspect of ancient historical study. The unit aims to encourage students to develop critical abilities in the process of exploring and evaluating particular events and personalities throughout this period. Another important part of learning is for the student to be able to develop and articulate his or her views on the unit itself.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>An important role for managers today is to make sense of the large quantities of data that are readily available by transforming such data to information that improves decision making. This unit provides an understanding of the statistical tools and techniques available to managers to do this. The importance of communicating statistical findings in a non-technical way is emphasised. Topics include research design, sampling and data collection, data visualisation, an introduction to business analytics and examining business relationships through appropriate modelling.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>While music history has tended to focus on composers or performers, this unit will focus instead on the activity of the listener, introducing students to histories and methods of listening. Through a series of case studies, students will learn about how practices of musical listening have been historically shaped by spaces and contexts, modes of attention, perceptions of time and structure, ideas about form, and shifting notions of the voice and body. Students will gain hands-on experience in interpretation and analysis through roundtable discussions, listening exercises and a research project.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Neuroendocrinology is the study of the integration between the central nervous system and hormonal systems. This unit builds on the knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology (APHB) undergraduate units by focusing on recent and cutting-edge developments in the field. Each of the three major themes/disciplines of neuroendocrinology are covered: (1) Reproduction (four seminars); (2) Metabolism and Obesity (four seminars); and (3) Stress (four seminars). Seminars consist of a broad description of a topic within a given discipline and then focus on a relevant and recent journal paper, providing critical interpretation and a basis of how this current research has shaped our knowledge. Based on these seminars, students then develop (through independent reading) and present a journal club-style presentation where they review a relevant journal paper. This oral presentation is accompanied by a written (assignment) in the form of an editorial comment.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to further develop public health knowledge and practice by addressing health issues in a developing country. The location may change from year to year and may be in rural Australia. The unit is tailored for the country that students visit and may involve working with a local non-government organisation (NGO), on a health issue identified as a priority for that NGO; or undertaking a series of site visits. The students interact with the local community members, local health professionals and community groups. The academic objectives are to (1) develop an appreciation and understanding of public health issues in a less developed country or region; (2) develop an understanding of cultural, economic, environmental and social determinants of health; (3) synthesise these factors into an understanding of the health in a less developed region of the world; (4) develop effective communication skills in a different cultural setting; and (5) build an understanding of an important developing country or region.
The unit may be offered virtually if circumstances make it not possible for travel.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The Global MD program is based around six themes of Professional, Leader, Advocate, Clinician, Educator and Scholar. This unit provides teaching in all these themes within the clinical attachments and related teaching in Year 4 of the Global MD course. This includes four-week duration clinical placements in emergency medicine and neurology. Students also undertake a four-week placement as a sub-Intern in an area of Primary Care medicine of their choosing as well as 4-weeks of discretionary time to prepare and take the USMLE Step 2 examination. In addition, students have eight -weeks of elective rotations during which they will conduct Residency interviews and application processes for their intended graduate-level training (Residencies are the U.S. equivalent of Internships in Australia). Students undertake clinical care of patients under the supervision of experienced clinicians in a real clinical environment including ward rounds, operating theatre experience, outpatient clinics, emergency department attachments, community practices and other clinical encounters. Students engage in small group learning sessions to discuss evidence-based practice in related clinical disciplines in hospital and community health contexts. Students are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes gained in context within these clinical rotations</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This Capstone unit for Political Science &amp; International Relations major integrates the main knowledge, skills, issues and methods identified in the study of the various units. It is focused on a learning approach seeking to solve real world problems and prepare students for future careers in a competitive job market. Students will learn to evaluate the complexity in the shaping, connection and negotiation of government policies in domestic and international spheres. For that purpose, the unit will bring in policy practitioners (such as diplomats, politicians, officials, and NGO activists), current and former, as guest lecturers to speak to the class on their career experiences. Students will also engage in simulation exercises, representing different countries to discuss and negotiate major contemporary issues in an international setting such as the United Nations, or representing different Australian government agencies/interest groups to debate other political issues. Further, students will design their own research project built around a real world challenge, writing up a policy position paper to analyse its complexity and suggest a policy for solution.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The impact of globalisation, constant change, technological advances, sustainability and the importance of values in society are some of the mega trends contributing to the changing definition of an organisation's 'bottom line'. Increasingly, effective leaders and organisations understand that ethics and sustainability management are an integral component of sound business and organisational functioning.
This unit is based on the belief that managers at all levels require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to identify and effectively respond to ethical challenges. The focus is on equipping students to make better decisions, as individuals and as practising managers. Regardless of setting, participants in the unit are well positioned to appropriately serve both the goals of organisations and the needs of society and the environment both in the short and long run, giving all consideration to the ethical challenges in question.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Geography is fundamentally about understanding the ways in which people and the environment interact to create the complex landscapes around us. This requires an understanding of the interaction of physical and human processes across time and geographic space. This unit develops concepts, skills and knowledge that enable students to engage in this process of ‘reading landscapes' through a case study of regional development and land degradation in the wheatbelt region of Western Australia. 
The unit is based on a compulsory week-long residential field trip (during Semester break week) that provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in research design, field observation and mapping, and the interpretation of field data and an appreciation of the challenges associated with managing complex landscapes. Students who do not attend the field trip during semester break cannot complete the unit.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In preparation for their first professional practice, students attend lectures and workshops to introduce them to the diverse nature of teachers' work and the competencies required for teaching and management of the learning environment. Students undertake 5 days of teaching practice (one week block). Professional practice experiences occur within government and non-government schools and educational settings under the guidance of a mentor teacher who provides assistance in planning, delivering and evaluating lessons/activities and management of the learning environment. In addition, lectures and workshops prior to the practicum experience, build on student understandings about teaching to explore and develop further key professional competencies and issues including professional duties, ethical responsibilities and duty of care.</ns1:description>

Students prepare an urban design proposal—usually for a mixed-use development, on a relatively clean-slate site in a strong physical context—with a given program and fixed design objectives analogous to the type of assignment that might be offered by a redevelopment authority or private developer. Technical competencies developed in the context of this exercise include areas such as place analysis, socio-demographic investigations, traffic planning, open space quality and function, phasing strategies and development controls. Where appropriate, current local projects are selected for the studio so that students have the opportunity to work directly with agencies and developers and contribute to topical design debates.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Meaning, Truth and Language</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is an introduction to the philosophy of language. Language is a fundamental feature of all our lives, and yet in many ways it remains quite mysterious. It focuses on two of the most interesting mysteries about language—what is linguistic meaning, and how do linguistic expressions come to possess it? In considering these questions the unit also considers questions about how meaning depends on context and the relation between the intended meaning of our utterances and their actual meaning. Students also contemplate the importance of the concept of truth in thinking about meaning. 
The unit aims to (1) provide students with the intellectual skills and knowledge to theorise about the nature of linguistic meaning in a deep and systematic way; (2) give students the tools necessary to engage with much contemporary philosophy (philosophy of language was seen as fundamental to analytic philosophy for much of the twentieth century and continues to have profound implications for most sub-disciplines); and (3) build on, and complement, two specific units offered by the School of Social Sciences and the School of Humanities (without these units being prerequisites)—LING3005 Semantics: Meaning in Language and PHIL2002 Logic: How to Defeat Your Foes with Reasoning.</ns1:description>

The pathologies or conditions covered are considered key domains for a clinical exercise physiologist across prevention, management and exercise rehabilitation. Across all topics the focus is on understanding the impact of the condition, the evidence around the role of exercise, and an ability to use that knowledge and evidence to inform and deliver exercise within clinical practice.
This unit will be assessed using a combination of blended learning assessment and feedback, incorporating theoretical and practical elements, problem based learning, case study analysis and simulated learning modes.
 There is a high practical component within this unit including assessment and delivery of an exercise management plan and participation in exercise assessment and prescription with peers.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit students will consider the two foundational pillars of contemporary Australian commercial law: secured transactions in personal property and e-commerce. The Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (PPSA) tackles the first pillar of secured transactions and is relevant to a broad range of everyday commercial transactions, such as bank lending, inventory financing, retail and consumer sales. Throughout the unit, students will learn not only the black-letter rules of PPSA and the relevant case law, but also commercial and policy considerations that underpin PPSA's rules. E-commerce is the second pillar of this unit and represents another vastly important aspect of contemporary commercial activity. Topics may include: online contracts, online defamation, Electronic Transaction Act, privacy, anti-spam legislation, and jurisdiction.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Agriculture and Economic Development</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit examines the role of agriculture in economic development, mainly in developing countries but with relevance to developed countries. Students learn how to apply economic theory and analytical tools to address agricultural development challenges faced by governments, and agents operating in the food and non-food sectors. Thematic areas covered include the economics of farm households, market failure and role of government in markets, food and nutrition security, agricultural productivity growth, technology adoption and impact evaluation, rural land reforms, climate change, and water crisis, agriculture and natural resource conservation, and policy instruments in international trade. A variety of topical questions are addressed, potentially including: what caused the global food crisis? How can we evaluate the appropriateness of government policies, such as fertilizer subsidies? What is the impact of water scarcity on global food security in an era of climate change? Why is land reform a thorny issue in developing countries? Are there opportunities to increase the efficiency of resource-poor producers? What are the effects of international trade and globalization on poor economies? What strategies and policies are needed to promote agricultural development? The unit is issue and problem solving oriented; it requires critical thinking and active participation. Policy implications of the topics are explored are discussed throughout the unit. Students debate and discuss contemporary issues in development, write policy briefs, and estimate empirical models relevant for formulating evidence-based policies.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This Level 2 unit in the history of ideas explores the development of 'civilisation' and 'barbarism' in European culture and thought since the Renaissance. Topics focus on critical and self-reflexive accounts of European civilisation, including the Renaissance discovery of otherness; the Enlightenment ideal of the 'noble savage'; post-Enlightenment critiques of civilisation; twentieth-century narratives of 'civilised violence' and civilisational decay; and contemporary reflections on the state of 'Europe' as a civilisational project. Students are introduced to theories of the dialectic of civilisation and barbarism and the civilising process. Literary and theoretical texts drawn from the European tradition are studied in sociohistorical context in order to arrive at a critical understanding of the development of European civilisational values.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from JAPN3407 Japanese 7. It further enhances students' linguistic skills in Japanese and their cultural literacy, develops their ability to critique contemporary social and cultural issues in Japanese, and equips them with effective expressions and communication techniques via the complex linguistic structures and vocabulary used in contemporary Japanese spoken and written discourses. 
Students develop their skills in (1) speaking and listening, by means of a research project presentation, discussion, and development of competence in academic registers in spoken language; and (2) reading and writing, by means of essay writing in academic format, critical reading of Japanese journal articles, and Japanese-to-English translation. Successful completion of this unit brings students to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level (JLPTL) N2 or the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (ISLPR) Level 4. The unit also facilitates future pathways into higher research on Japan through promoting critical selection and utilisation of Japanese-language source materials.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Good, Bogus and Corrupted Science</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In this age of unsurpassed scientific enlightenment, it is of concern that so many individuals, regulatory bodies, learned institutions and governments fall prey to the misleading messages of bogus science and corrupted science. The primary goal of this postgraduate/honours unit is to sensitise the research-trained students to this reality and provide them with the knowledge and skills to not only distinguish genuine scientific findings from spurious ones, but also understand why and how the industries and institutions supporting corrupted and bogus science are flourishing. Given that some of the proponents of bogus science rely on arguments inspired from the teachings of the philosophy of science and epistemology, the unit starts with an overview of the highly contentious philosophical problem of demarcation between scientific and non-scientific knowledge by providing a brief analysis of the work of Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend and of more recent thinkers. It then explores how evidence-based knowledge arises in science and the role of peer review in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. After exploring how bogus science fails to meet these requirements, the unit examines how bogus science is promoted and made so appealing, and explore how and why even well educated individuals fall prey to it. Then, the unit addresses the importance of being critical of scientific knowledge as well. It explains the various forms of scientific misconduct, examines the issue of fraud in science, and explores the psychosocial underpinnings of corrupted behaviours. The unit also examines how ideological, political, economic and other interests impose themselves on scientific objectivity and integrity, and identifies the potential problems posed by the commodification of academic research. Finally, the unit describes the strategies often adopted to undermine scientists and society's trust in their work, and explores the ways science is manipulated by interest groups and by those making legal decisions and public policy.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to develop students' ability to apply fundamental knowledge and analysis methods for structural steel design based on Australian Standards such as AS1170 and AS4100. The topics covered include load calculations, design of tension member, design of compression member, design of bending member, design of combined actions, design of connections and fatigue design, etc. Students who pass the unit have opportunities to work in areas such as analysis and design, construction and management of steel structures. This is an introduction to the design of structural elements through the principles of limit states design. The unit includes the assessment of loads and load combinations, the assemblage of members to resist those loads and the design of individual members within an assemblage. Principal structural members are designed to resist tension, compression, bending and combinations of tension and compression with bending. Connections are a combination of both welded and bolted systems. Fatigue design of structural elements is also included. The main objectives of the unit are to develop students' ability to analyse structural loads and structural members and apply the results of these analyses to practical steel structure design.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Michelangelo had a long and prolific career as a painter, sculptor, architect, draftsman and poet. Already during his lifetime, Michelangelo was celebrated as a divine genius and by the time of his death in 1564 it was hard to separate the man from the myth. In this seminar-style unit students attempt to reconstruct the artist's mind by studying how Michelangelo, through his artistic practice, reflected on the nature of art. The master's major works are subjected to a close visual and historiographical analysis, and placed within a broader theoretical and artistic fifteenth- and sixteenth-century framework.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is an introduction to Latin for students who have never before studied this language or who have had minimal instruction in it. It introduces students primarily to the changing forms of Latin words (their 'inflected morphology') and in so doing provides a grounding in basic grammar which is of fundamental benefit to English expression (as well as being of great utility for the acquisition of other modern languages). The unit is taught through formal grammar exercises and through the translation of simplified extracts from ancient Latin texts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Historiography is the study of how history is written. How can we 'know' the past? What assumptions underpin our historical methods? What truth claims can historians validly make? Part 1 analyses three major schools of history writing from the nineteenth century to the present: positivist (or empiricist) history; social and cultural history; and the challenges posed to history by postmodernism. Part 2 consists of three modules, each of which addresses the theoretical underpinnings, strengths and weaknesses of one particular form of recent historiography, concentrating on the works of major writers in the field. Each of the historiographical approaches have their own claims to validity, and have mounted strong critiques of the others. 
The academic objectives of this unit are (1) to familiarise students with, and develop a critical understanding of, the literature on historiography; (2) to develop an understanding of the relationship between different concepts of and approaches to history; and (3) to evaluate both the claims and the criticisms of these concepts and approaches.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Ideas shaping contemporary Human Rights have deep historical roots, drawing on religious and secular ethics, morality and social justice in various societies and cultures. This unit asks: how did Human Rights evolve? Are Human Rights the product of a peculiarly European heritage, or is its moral, cultural, and political basis far wider than this? In what ways are Human Rights different from individual rights, legal rights and civil rights? Did human rights serve as a 'civilizing' mask for colonialism, and what has been the relationship between decolonisation and the question of rights? We examine the impact of the American and French Revolutions on the advancement of ideas about human rights, and how other threads such as the law, the Cold War, Apartheid, and the 'War on Terror' have undermined them. We also examine the impacts of slavery, imperialism, war, and genocide, as well as responses to them, and global movements such as civil, indigenous, women's, and minority rights, and the rise of the modern human rights movement. On the completion of the unit students should have honed applicable skills such as: critical thinking and analysis; comprehension and application of knowledge; and research, written and communication skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces concepts of Bayesian statistics and illustrates how to apply them to various areas of scientific research. Self-implemented algorithms and probabilistic programming languages (WinBugs, JAGS and/or Stan) are introduced, and the interfaces of the latter to the statistical computing and graphics environment R are discussed. Some computational aspects underlying these probabilistic programming languages are discussed to justify the framework of these algorithms. The algorithms are used, either directly or via their R interface, to fit statistical models within a Bayesian framework to real-world examples from many disciplines such as engineering, science (e.g. agricultural, biological, environmental, medical and physical), social sciences, economics, finance and astronomy.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The tools of research and evidence based practice have helped us answer and understand some of the most important health and medical questions and saved millions of lives—what's good for our health and what does harm in the world around us? In this unit, students are introduced to key concepts and methods used in clinical epidemiology, research study design, statistical reasoning and how it can be used to describe, monitor and manage the health of individuals and populations and in the conduct of research or other scholarly inquiry.  One of the great challenges in health and medical research and its use in clinical practice is deciding whether the results are because of the treatment/intervention applied, some other influences out there in the big world, or random chance. Students apply the principles and skills of evidence based practice to critically select, read, interpret and use health and medical evidence.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit intends to foster the development of the student as a clinician, a team member, an ethical professional, an advocate and an educator. Students develop their information literacy skills as applied to clinical podiatric medicine and the interactions with paediatric individuals, those who are mentally, physically or differently abled and those affected by mental health, behavioural and psychiatric conditions. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and the clinical skills of history-taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours and understanding of the patient perspective and of patient-centred care to engage in collaborative diverse practice. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are introduced along with the opportunity to discuss the main issues in social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics relating to the following specific population groups; paediatric individuals, those who are mentally, physically or differently abled and those affected by mental health, behavioural and psychiatric conditions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from IND2404 Indonesian 4 or INDO2204 Indonesian Intermediate II and leads to INDO3406 Indonesian 6. It allows students to achieve 'social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2+ of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). Students explore social, cultural and political issues, both prescribed and of their own choice. This is done through exposure to a wide range of authentic, contemporary Indonesian language material, including fiction, newspapers, radio and television/film. Students are required to use internet resources to keep themselves up to date on the social and political changes taking place in Indonesian society. They develop reading, writing and translation skills in official, colloquial and literary styles. They also participate in conversation classes and are exposed to a variety of recorded material. In addition they work on language development (structure and grammar), both in a prescribed way and also in response to questions about the texts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit consolidates concepts introduced in PHCY5618 Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Analysis as well as PHCY5610 Physical Pharmacy and Biopharmaceutics. It focuses on the relationships between chemical structure and biological activity of various drugs. Emphasis is on basic principles, broad structure–activity relationships and the mechanisms of action (where known) of a range of important drugs in a number of classes (e.g. antibacterials and antivirals, anticancer drugs, cholinergics and adrenergics, steroids and analgesics) as well as the chemical strategies that have been adopted to optimise their activity. These concepts also require an appreciation of the chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids as these macromolecules constitute common drug targets. Further, the unit introduces students to the drug development process and explores sources of lead compounds as well as strategies of lead optimisation. Additionally, technical and analytical skills in methods commonly employed in drug isolation, identification and analysis are acquired and refined.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Social Work and Mental Health Practice has been developed to comply with the Australian Association of Social Workers Mental Health Competencies (2014) and the National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce (2013).  The Australian Association of Social Workers Mental Health Competencies (2014) and National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce (2013) documents provides the broad framework for this series of lecture/seminars.    The purpose of social work practice in mental health is to assist to restore individual, family, and community well-being, and to promote principles of social justice.  Social works clinical practice occurs at the interface between the individual and the environment; social work activity begins with the individual, and extends to the contexts of family, social networks, community, and the broader society.  
This unit will examine the two important aspects governing clinical practice in a mental health context.  This will include theoretical modalities (knowledge, models of understanding), and clinical intervention strategies (techniques, therapeutic modalities).  All the theoretical models examined, where possible, will be evidenced based practice models (EBPs). 
The philosophical framework governing this unit from the mental health perspective is the biopsychosocial model, which consciously attempts to incorporate all of the significant dimensions in human existence in order to optimally conceptualise our understanding of the human condition in general and mental health issues specifically.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. This unit considers the philosophical and theoretical foundations of social work. Students consider in depth the interface between abstract notions of purposes and place and social work as an embodied activity. To provide context for their research, they are required to engage with and critique dominant discourses, current and historical, and to explore theoretical frameworks and practice principles as they are applied and operationalised, in their practice setting and globally.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>OneHealth is an approach that recognises that the health of humans, the environment and animals is interdependent.  Outbreaks of human diseases with animal origins, such as ebola, SARS, H5N1 and most recently COVID-19, have highlighted the need for this approach   This unit aims to give students an understanding of the concept of OneHealth and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to tackling OneHealth issues.
The objectives of the unit are to (i) Equip students with the knowledge of the ways human, environment and animal health are interdependent and the ways this interdependency may manifest itself; (ii) Give students experience in applying their knowledge to OneHealth problems; (iii) Instill in students an appreciation of the need to apply multidisciplinary approaches.
Through the use of case studies and problem based learning exercises students will gain insight into various aspects of OneHealth.  Case studies will allow the students to examine known zoonotic diseases to see how the issue developed and how it was tackled, while the problem based learning exercises will have the students work out what may be causing the disease outbreak and how best to tackle it.</ns1:description>

Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. It involves the comprehensive examination, diagnosis and management of patients that have been referred to the OHCWA Specialist Prosthodontics Clinic. Students are supervised during clinical sessions by specialist prosthodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the prosthodontic clinic over the three years of the course. Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training. This logbook is assessed throughout the unit and at the end of the third year of the course by the external examiner(s). The content will develop the fundamental skills for specialist prosthodontic clinical practice including oral rehabilitation with fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics. Students will learn through clinical management of patients while being supervised by specialist prosthodontists, together with pre-clinical exercises, laboratory work, workshops, and student case presentations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces fundamental concepts of Bayesian statistics and illustrates how to apply them to various areas of scientific research.  Probabilistic programming languages (WinBugs, JAGS and/or Stan) are introduced, and their interfaces to the statistical computing and graphics environment R are discussed. These languages are used, either directly or via their R interface, to fit statistical models within a Bayesian framework to real-world examples from many disciplines such as engineering, science (e.g. agricultural, biological, environmental, medical and physical), social sciences, economics, finance and astronomy.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>What to Do? How to Make Rational Decisions under Uncertainty</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Just about any decision we make is made under conditions of uncertainty.  This goes for common everyday decisions, such as whether to bring an umbrella or whether to cross the street, where we face uncertainty about rain and traffic accidents respectively. But it also goes for big life-changing decisions at the personal level, e.g., choosing a university degree or life partner, and at the policy level, e.g., choosing a policy to address climate change or income inequality. What should we believe in the face of uncertainty? And how can we take uncertainty into account when choosing what to do?
This unit will introduce you to rational choice theory, which aims to answer such questions. The basic ingredients of most views in rational choice theory are probabilities, which are used to represent the decision-maker's beliefs about how likely different possibilities are, and utilities, which represent the decision-maker's preferences. We will spend the majority of this unit discussing and criticizing these central notions.
More specifically, we will look at the interpretation of probability, expected utility theory as the dominant view in decision theory, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, paradoxes in decision theory, Dutch Book arguments, the recently popular epistemic utility theory, and game theory.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>We are currently on the precipice of an exponential expansion of environmental data. Sensors for a wide range of variables relevant to environmental quality have been emerging alongside interest in sensor networks and centralised data repositories to study environmental change.  These are increasingly being applied by government agencies, consultants and interest groups as part of environmental research and management activities. Students will develop skills in the design, deployment and data analysis associated with sensing infrastructure. We use a range of  platforms to measure atmospheric, soil and water environments, to experience first-hand the challenges of using sensor systems, including their strategic deployment in real field environments, and the subsequent analysis and post-processing of data.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to strategic leadership and innovation in the context of the oceans. In particular it explores the concepts of leadership and strategy. Students explore how strategy is used within organisations and the strategic planning process. The concept of entrepreneurship is critical in identifying solutions to ocean challenges, and it is explored in terms of what it means and what is it useful for. Understanding the behaviour of individuals and groups within an organisation and their interaction is also an important element of strategic leadership. This is analysed as well as—how managers lead strategic planning and manage strategic vision and change; how innovation can be encouraged and developed and the policy issues associated with this; the differences and similarities between strategic leadership in the private and public spheres; and the interplay of organisations in the ocean context.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Why does industry pollute so much? Can it pollute less? Does it want to? Businesses vary greatly, from the model firm leading in sustainable business practices to the heavy polluter that seems to go only for the quick buck. How can you explain such diversity? Is it just because some are 'good guys' and others 'bad guys', or is there more to it? This unit addresses these questions and asks: (1) Under what conditions will a business want to improve its management of the environment? (2) How can government and society effectively encourage businesses to want to do better? (3) What aspects of business managers' attitudes and behaviour do we need to understand to better know how they can improve their management of the environment?
This unit is organized into weekly topics that roughly correspond to the chapters of a core textbook, and each week contains three sessions. Topics include environmental externalities, stakeholder analysis, environmental accounting and reporting, environmental management systems and life-cycle-assessment, environmental investments, risk management and insurance, as well as eco-labelling and eco-certification. Each week, session 1 focuses on key concepts and an understanding of the issues based around key chapter readings. Session 2 is a lab session using Internet resources, where students search in small groups for information on a specific industry of their choice. This session also introduces them to some key online databases where they learn how to search for information quickly and efficiently. Session 3 focuses on behavioural aspects of business decision making in relation to environmental (mis)management. In this session, students are introduced to behavioural economics as well as to economic experiments, which are core tools in the study of economic behaviour.  Students in this unit have various backgrounds: Science, Engineering, Business and also Arts (e.g. business ethics).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit assesses both the evolution and contemporary application of design thinking. The approach is human-centred and collaborative. It starts by asking 'what is design thinking?' and explores both the philosophy of design and the ethical issues associated with contemporary design challenges. Design as a way of thinking is approached through understanding the context, asking the right questions, and integrating creative and rational strategies in generating and applying appropriate solutions. This approach to problem solving is inherently heuristic, i.e. it is creative, iterative and practical in both its process and application. Design research and methodologies are examined and contemporary design practice is investigated using case studies drawn from a wide range of design disciplines and with particular relevance to architecture.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Economic Policy and Communication</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to equip students with skills in the communication of economics. Economists view the world through several different lenses. This, in turn, is often a source of disagreement amongst economists and economic policy advisers. Disagreement within the profession often allows non-economists to dismiss or criticise economics and disregard contributions made by economists to economic debates.  Fundamentally, economics is a way of thinking. It offers a powerful framework to help identify trade-offs and policy interventions. To engage in economic debate and influence policy makers, it is critical that economists know how to talk about models, present facts and figures, and distinguish facts from opinion. In this unit you will learn how to communicate economics to a wide range of audiences, including policy makers, politicians and other with no training in economics. Students will learn how to write policy briefs, to use visual tools, and to deal with the media. They will gain insight into how effective communication can be used to influence stakeholders and create change. The instruction will be via a series of guest lectures followed by reflection workshops and through several group and individual assignments.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The Global Lawyer</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on international and transnational practice. It takes students beyond the traditional Australian and common law concentration. Students are introduced to legal systems from other countries, explore strategies for international research, and develop skills necessary to practice in different cultures and systems, and to interact with clients and lawyers from other jurisdictions.
This unit aims to introduce students to the increasingly important implications of practicing global law, and understanding the impact of digital technologies in legal practice and in the lawyer's own professional identity, including the impact of social media. It seeks to make students aware of the opportunities in international practice as the role of traditional lawyering is broadened, as well as the responsibilities of being a global, digital lawyer. 
Students start by exploring the origin of transnational practice, highlighting the importance of today's lawyer engaging in global practice. They are then introduced to the ethical concerns and responsibilities involved in being an international lawyer, before moving onto an overview of the domestic legal systems of important players in the international legal arena. A discussion of the impact of global legal practice on minorities within the legal community encourages students to think of the larger socio-economic implications of cross-border practice. International management and firm operation is dealt with as students are challenged with the problem of how to maintain local identity while providing international service.</ns1:description>

With the emergence of online viewing platforms and the prevalence of personal devices, the distinctions between traditional broadcast television and cinema screened in theatres have decisively changed. In this unit we look at televisual and cinematic drama. In particular we examine what is being termed a new 'golden age' in televisual drama that has coincided with the paradigm shift toward online streaming. But we also look at the continuing relevance of cinema, particularly the cinematic language of Hollywood which provides the basic formal structures of screen narrative.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an integrative understanding of the distribution of the Australian flora, past and present, and of current Australian vegetation types and their relationships with a dynamic environment. Students become familiar with the quantitative characterisation of their environment by classifying plant communities according to structural and physiognomic attributes, and analysing field data for patterns of diversity and community organisation. Students also learn how vegetation mapping, inventory and interpretation of remotely sensed data are based on understanding vegetation structure and that this knowledge underpins local, regional and national management capabilities. The unit appeals to students interested in botany, ecology, land and water management, conservation biology, restoration ecology and agriculture.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The final year of the MD has a continuing emphasis on clinical skills, communication and discipline specific expertise, but with an emphasis on further developing decision-making skills and work readiness. Students
will advance their capacity to develop differential diagnoses based upon clinical findings, formulate rational investigation plans and develop proficiency in formulating patient management and treatment plans. There is also a continuing emphasis on working in interprofessional teams. This will occur through clinical placements in general medicine (including geriatric and palliative medicine), psychiatry, critical care (including anaesthetics, emergency medicine and intensive care), surgery, otorhinolaryngology and
musculoskeletal disciplines. Students will be required to complete a four-week rural rotation and may also have access to selective rotations. Experiential learning will occur in the hospital and community settings. Studentswill also complete a capstone project in the form of an audit or a piece of clinical research. After the end-of-year examinations, students undertake a four-week elective experience that is designed to extend learning in an area of medicine that is of particular interest to them.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the principles of agricultural and environmental research and provides students exposure to the diversity of investigation methods relevant to this research. Students are given the opportunity to experience these research methods being applied to ‘real world' agricultural and environmental science issues. It is delivered through a mix of online and face-to-face sessions, which includes a field camp in Albany. Module 1 focuses on the establishment of context and the formulation of research questions and hypotheses for testing and examines potential tools available to test these hypotheses. Working in groups with a mentor, students will be exposed to selected agricultural and environmental research projects and will be asked to critique these examples in Module 2. Students have the opportunity to conduct their own research project in Module 3 when they focus on data collection and analysis at a selected site and will learn how best to communicate their findings. This unit involves undertaking fieldwork in the Great Southern region, usually scheduled for the week before the mid-semester break.</ns1:description>

Because methods in linguistics are inseparable from theoretical considerations, the unit also deals with the crucial theoretical proposals driving participant selection, data collection and data analysis and interpretation. The study of how best to investigate the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic aspects of a particular phenomenon is critically examined when relevant. Students discuss macro- and micro-level linguistic approaches from a quantitative and/or a qualitative perspective.</ns1:description>

Students cover the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, anatomical pathology and pharmacology. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and the clinical skills of medical history-taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours and understanding of the patient perspective and of patient-centred care. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are introduced along with the opportunity to discuss the main issues in social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics. Students have opportunities to develop their information literacy skills as applied to medicine. Introduction to professional aspects of medical practice includes professional behaviours, medical law and ethics, leadership and teamwork, collaborative practice, educational theory and practice, diversity within medicine, and Aboriginal health.
Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the Workplace-based placements.
The content and pedagogy of this unit is designed to meet and deliver toward AMC standards and to meet the conversion requirement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Food needs to be produced more efficiently and sustainably. There are now rapid changes in the agricultural sector, particularly with developments in agricultural technology and sensors. This technology is data-driven and has the potential to significantly increase production efficiency and reduce the environmental impact from agriculture; however, the key is making good decisions from the data. In this unit, students will utilise their agricultural knowledge and skills in data science, geographic information systems (GIS) and sensors. The unit teaches students to integrate their knowledge of farming systems with technology-derived data to make decisions for improved production efficiency and profitability.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Health Analytics</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit will introduce students to data analytics in the large and growing health sector. There is an increasing demand to make sense of the large quantities of health data readily available in both the public and private health sector to improve decision making and policy design. This unit provides an understanding of the range of methods used by health economists and professionals for the statistical analysis of survey data. There is a strong emphasis on applications, illustrating the use of relevant computer software applied to large scale data sets. 
The purpose of the unit is to provide a practical guide to the analysis of health data that is built around a series of case studies based on recent health economics research. The unit is divided into 5 key parts. The first part focuses on health measures and describing and summarising health data. The second part introduces the multivariate analysis of health survey data and issues of how to identify causal effects from empirical data. The third part introduces health equity and the estimation of heterogeneous effects across different subpopulations. The fourth part moves from cross-sectional to longitudinal data, introducing applications with linear and non-linear panel data regression models. Part five turns to methods that are suitable for modelling individual data on health care utilisation when that is measured by the number of visits or by levels of expenditure.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Prosthodontics Theory III (Part 1)</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the first part of the third-year theory unit in Prosthodontics for the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit is a continuation of the first- and second-year Prosthodontics Theory I and Prosthodontics Theory II units.
The unit provides the theoretical foundation of the clinical practice of prosthodontics including diagnosis, comprehensive treatment planning, oral and maxillofacial rehabilitation, and maintenance of oral functions (mastication and phonetics), patient related quality of life, dento-facial aesthetics, and health of patients with prosthodontic needs. The third-year theory units advance the students' knowledge and comprehension of the advanced theoretical aspects of prosthodontics, to a level which is commensurate with the level to be expected for a specialist prosthodontist.
This unit within the DCD program in prosthodontics will encompass the following areas of knowledge: prosthodontic assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning, including the endodontic, orthodontic and periodontic interfacesclassical and contemporary literature in the fields of prosthodontics and oral implantologythe principles involved in the design and laboratory manufacturing of prostheses for the restoration and/or replacement of oral and maxillofacial structurescontemporary tooth replacement with removable, fixed and implant prosthesesfundamentals of oral tissue regeneration, tissue biology and the surgical aspects of implant prosthodonticsmaxillofacial prosthodonticsdental material science and applications in prosthodontics and oral implantologythe principles of occlusion and occlusal rehabilitationthe principles of phonetics and speech pathology related to prosthodonticsthe management and treatment planning of complex cases with interdisciplinary engagementthe principles and application of pharmacology in prosthodontic practice and oral implantologyprosthodontic considerations of airways and sleep disorders, including their relation to oral manifestations of tooth wear and overall patient wellbeing, andthe basis and management of orofacial painStudents will advance their theoretical knowledge on the clinical practice of prosthodontics through prescribed readings, seminars, tutorials, discussions and student presentations. Seminars prepared by students are presented to the entire DCD Prosthodontic cohort.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Prosthodontics Theory III (Part 2)</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the second part of the third-year theory unit in Prosthodontics for the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit is a continuation of the first- and second-year Prosthodontics Theory I and Prosthodontics Theory II units.
The unit provides the theoretical foundation of the clinical practice of prosthodontics including diagnosis, comprehensive treatment planning, oral and maxillofacial rehabilitation, and maintenance of oral functions (mastication and phonetics), patient related quality of life, dento-facial aesthetics, and health of patients with prosthodontic needs. The third-year theory units advance the students' knowledge and comprehension of the advanced theoretical aspects of prosthodontics, to a level which is commensurate with the level to be expected for a specialist prosthodontist.
This unit within the DCD program in prosthodontics will encompass the following areas of knowledge: prosthodontic assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning, including the endodontic, orthodontic and periodontic interfacesclassical and contemporary literature in the fields of prosthodontics and oral implantologythe principles involved in the design and laboratory manufacturing of prostheses for the restoration and/or replacement of oral and maxillofacial structurescontemporary tooth replacement with removable, fixed and implant prosthesesfundamentals of oral tissue regeneration, tissue biology and the surgical aspects of implant prosthodonticsmaxillofacial prosthodonticsdental material science and applications in prosthodontics and oral implantologythe principles of occlusion and occlusal rehabilitationthe principles of phonetics and speech pathology related to prosthodonticsthe management and treatment planning of complex cases with interdisciplinary engagementthe principles and application of pharmacology in prosthodontic practice and oral implantologyprosthodontic considerations of airways and sleep disorders, including their relation to oral manifestations of tooth wear and overall patient wellbeing, andthe basis and management of orofacial painStudents will advance their theoretical knowledge on the clinical practice of prosthodontics through prescribed readings, seminars, tutorials, discussions and student presentations. Seminars prepared by students are presented to the entire DCD Prosthodontic cohort.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Applied Statistics and Data Visualisation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Statistical methods are used to analyse data in a wide variety of fields (e.g. engineering, medicine, agriculture, business, economics, psychology, genetics, criminology, the social sciences). While statistical theory can be helpful in analysing such data, its direct application may be limited by practical problems. For example, some of the data may be missing, some observations may be inconsistent with the rest of the data, the standard assumptions (e.g. normality) may fail, and the standard methods may not answer the important questions. The best way to learn how to deal with these practical problems is to gain experience in analysing real data. This unit provides that experience through case studies and projects. The emphasis is on applying statistical methods to interesting practical problems rather than on the theory behind the methods. 
The unit covers applications of a number of widely used statistical techniques selected from generalised linear models, nonlinear regression models, advanced regression topics, survival analysis, non-parametric statistics, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis.  Furthermore, throughout the unit a large emphasis is placed on data visualisation techniques.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on a set of related questions concerning life and death such as—Is it rational to fear death? What, if anything, gives human beings a special moral status? Do any other animals have a similar status? Is it morally acceptable to kill them for food? Is euthanasia, the killing of those who are incurably ill and in great pain or distress, for their own sake, morally justified? If so, under what circumstances exactly? What is the moral status of abortion? Students become familiar with some of the most influential works on such questions. As well as learning about such substantive issues, students also deepen their understanding of ethical reasoning in general, and sharpen their ability to understand, evaluate and construct arguments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, estuaries and coasts, supply a diversity of ecosystem services that support humanity. They have also been subject to exploitation and degradation at a global scale in response to development pressures. Critical to planning for the sustainable use and management of aquatic environments is an understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern ecosystem interactions and their ability to support biodiversity. This unit provides students with an understanding of how inland and marine ecosystems function, and develops practical skills associated with field, laboratory and modelling based investigations. Case studies of diverse aquatic system types are explored, and associated issues including contamination, Harmful Algal Blooms, habitat loss and biodiversity loss are explored. Management approaches and technologies to restore and sustainably develop aquatic environments are also covered, including approaches to environmental water delivery, nutrient management and ecosystem restoration. Students will participate in a five day field trip. In 2019 the field trip is in Albany.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the idea of international society as an evolving global society of states, characterised by geopolitical rivalry and contested ideas of sovereignty, which has become institutionalised through the United Nations since 1945.  The unit focuses on key processes and events in the expansion of the global society of states, such as decolonisation and the Cold War. It includes an evaluation of different theoretical approaches to the phenomena of the global society of states, and some consideration of the extent to which the core institutions of this society including the United Nations have evolved through effective reform since the Cold War.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline (mainly focusing on underground mining). Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of this unit is on teamwork skills and the design process. Even though no field trip is scheduled in this unit, some industry experts in the relevant fields are invited to provide engineering discussions that will be helpful in the decision-making process for the project.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on professional scientific oral communication skills. One tutorial on 'How to present a seminar' is delivered at the beginning of semesters 1 and 2 to cater for the two intakes of honours students. Students attend all presentations in the seminar appraisal and presentation (SCB) seminar series. In the first two-thirds of their Honours Program, students attend interactive seminar appraisal sessions for four of these seminars, and present a critique to the group. Students then demonstrate their acquired knowledge and skills in a formal presentation of their research at the end of their honours program. The main academic objectives are for students to gain the ability to recognise quality presentation styles and content, and develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. They also learn how to construct an oral presentation that is visually attractive and scientifically robust, and deliver the information in a lucid and logical manner.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice I Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the first year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics  Clinic Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:
clinical assesssment (ongoing) (50%)
case presentation (30%)
clinical logbook (20%)</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Everything on the Earth exists in some place and time. Location is an important part of understanding the nature of a phenomenon and its relationships with other aspects of a system. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are now widely accepted as a technology for examining objects and events in space and time, and spatial analysis is an important skill which is required in many disciplines and careers. This unit introduces postgraduate students to GIS, providing training in both the use of the software and the analysis of spatial data. The unit covers the application of GIS in a number of fields/disciplines. Students are introduced to core concepts in GIS and analytical techniques, including spatial sampling, interaction models, and spatial statistics. Students are also provided instruction in the presentation of spatial data and the development of a spatial analytic project from start to finish.
The goal of this unit is to develop an understanding of spatial data and spatial analysis; develop spatial problem-solving abilities; acquire knowledge and skills in GIS across a broad set of applications. Lectures cover fundamentals in the spatial representation of real-world objects, map projections, cartography, data development, and spatial analytic techniques. Laboratories follow lecture/discussions to optimize learning.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to leverage the specialist skills and knowledge from existing and visiting academic staff, and the content and delivery style will therefore change every semester.  The unit will usually have a different topic focus delivered - e.g. based upon a composer, or a style of music, or historical events, or new research within a specific field.  The topic focus will be advertised before each semester to enable students to decide whether the topic focus aligns with their interests and/or specialisation.
The unit will typically engage with theoretical, historical, and practical elements related to the topic.  Three hypothetical examples may indicate the flexibility of this unit:
1. a topic focussed upon a Parisian nineteenth-century female composer-pianist may investigate social norms within Parisian society, the role of salons, their influence upon the development of keyboard instruments, aspects of musical scholarship and criticism, musical elements relating to rubato, dynamics, pedaling, typesetting and engraving.  
2. a topic focussed upon research in music technologies and focus upon a case study of the technology, the product development cycle, the role of business and marketing, the process of testing with musicians. 
3. a topic focussed upon scholarship in a specific performance practice may incorporate theoretical knowledge, critical exploration of key texts, development of performance materials (e.g. printed scores), and a performance project.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit builds on the practical skills of rural clinicians as educators. It begins with a discussion forum about the principles of successful teaching based on clinicians' prior experience. Students identify an educational topic of interest in their practice and/or professional development. They are then guided through current educational literature on this topic to develop achievable learning objectives. The students spend time together and with lecturers to develop a short course that could be taught in their practice community. Discussions about how to assess the efficacy of their course enables the selection of appropriate evaluation tools and methods. As practicable, students are invited to implement their course and receive feedback. They are invited to systematically reflect on their practice. Finally, real and dummy data are used to assist students to consider how they would prepare a report, conference presentation or publication of their education project.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of this unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Jane Austen and her Legacy</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit offers a close examination of Jane Austen's major novels and analyses the profound influence she has had on contemporary culture. We try to account for why television and cinematic adaptations, and fan-fiction reinventions and mashups of her work continue to appear at a prolific rate. The unit begins by situating Austen as a novelist writing in a particular historical era at the turn of the nineteenth century, with Britain rapidly emerging as one of Europe's foremost maritime and imperial powers. Austen was well aware that the emerging novel form was inspiring lively discussions of its moral and educative effects on a growing, substantially female readership. While her novels have been celebrated down the ages as archetypal romances, the unit draws on recent scholarly debates in order to understand Austen's novels as invested in contributing to social and political conversations of her era. Students consider the ethics of Austen's novels which can be interpreted as promoting sociable virtues and as extolling companionate marriage in a period in which sharply defined gender roles generated incomprehension and misunderstanding between the sexes. Throughout the unit students examine Austen's extraordinary influence on popular culture as a romantic, melancholic and ironic author.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the development of ethnic and national identities in the context of European history, society and culture. Literary and theoretical texts are studied in historical context in order to arrive at a critical understanding of the development of ethnicity and national identity as psychosocial categories; the ways in which ethnicity has been used in the service of nationalist ideologies and identifications; and the ways in which ethnicity and national identity have been represented in European literature and culture at different times. In the process of engaging with this literary, cultural and historical material, students further extend their skills in research and documentation, clear and accurate summation and presentation of arguments, critical analysis and interpretation, and succinct synthesis and statement of conclusions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit will examine one of the most fundamentally important practice dynamics, specifically: the therapeutic relationship. Throughout our professional training and clinical experience, we emphasise the singular importance of the therapeutic relationship. It is the most commonly cited dimension within the clinical and research literature for therapeutic success.  We all refer to it continually, but what really is it? Do we know what we mean when we refer the therapeutic relationship? We will break down the concept of the therapeutic relationship and examine how to optimally promote the various aspects of this relational dynamic in clinical contexts.
Whilst the importance of assessment is usually acknowledged, all too often it is discipline and department specific, and often linked to exclusion criteria.  A form of psychodynamic assessment will be examined and presented as an alternative form of assessment that may be applicable in varied clinical contexts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Global population size is expected to reach between 9.5 billion by 2050 and amongst the challenges facing the world is the need to develop effective and efficient methods of waste disposal. This unit focuses on the theoretical, practical and technological advances in waste processing allowing humanity to move toward a zero-waste ecosystem.  Academics and industrialists will cover the basic types of waste streams generated by our activities.  They will cover the rationale and strategies behind  zero waste policies and the current work in developing products from our wastes, such as energy and protein sources, which can then enter the circular economy. Enabling technologies such as anaerobic digestion, composting, biological reactors and algal biosystems will be explored as well as specific examples of industrial deployment through field visits and industry guest lecturers.  This unit is modular and will include examples specific to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to allow students with different backgrounds to gain fundamental knowledge of waste processing, supplemented with examples pertinent to their study path.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice III Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the third-year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease and implant treatment. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics and Implant   Clinics.  Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam (with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:
clinical assessment (50%)
case presentation (30%)
clinical logbook (20%)</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Clinical and neuropsychological assessment and treatment of common neurodevelopmental disorders requires an understanding of normal cognitive development as well as the aetiology, developmental trajectory and underlying neuropsychological profiles. This facilitates the ability to identify comorbid and differential diagnoses and work with children and families in an effective manner. Thus, it is essential that Clinical Psychologists and Neuropsychologists stay abreast of the theory and research in this field so they can understand the difficulties faced by their clients, develop competencies in evidence-based assessment practices and implement appropriate therapies and interventions.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Critical Thinking and Reasoning</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">0</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Critical thinking and reasoning are fundamental skills required for rational, evidence-based  argumentation. These high order skills are not just necessary for academic studies, but are actively sought by business employers seeking prospective employees with strong reasoning and problem solving skills to ensure continuation of operational productivity. Moreover, educators often demand students to construct cohesive, logically structured expositions to test theoretical knowledge; consequently, this unit aims to explicitly teach components of reasoned argumentation. By scrutinising the anatomy of an argument, students will learn to identify elements of reasoning; distinguish characteristics of varying types of arguments; and recognise elements of faulty reasoning.
Application of this knowledge will enable students to produce reasoned argumentation and possess the ability to critically analyse and evaluate credibility of various arguments in business contexts. Furthermore, within this robust and inquiring environment, students will also develop skills of information processing, problem solving and creative thinking. Finally, the teaching of metacognitive strategies will encourage students to reflect and assess the efficacy of their higher order thinking strategies, a necessary attribute of lifelong learners.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The Global Family</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The human species evolved and dispersed across the globe as part of small kin-based groups. Family networks and family histories continue to be a crucial way in which people everywhere understand their place in the world and their connections to others, past and present. Notions of relatedness, ancestry, genealogy and belonging are also highly politicised and frequently invoked in postcolonial, national and legal settings. Rapid advances in genetic technologies and unprecedented global movements of people make it vital to understand the practical and ethical context in which DNA studies, genealogies and family histories are gathered and used for a variety of ends.  
This unit gives students the practical skills to construct genealogies and trace family histories while exploring the cultural, legal and ethical concerns that surround these. It covers five main areas: (a) genetics, human diversity and similarity; (b) historical movements, migrations and removals of peoples across the globe; (c) culturally diverse understandings of family, kinship and belonging; (d) how to research and record genealogies, family histories and biographical information; and (e) ethical, political and legal issues surrounding the use and abuse of genealogical information.
The unit is delivered in two distinct parts—a five-week online component consisting of the above five modules, and a one-week face-to-face teaching block based in the Great Southern region, where students undertake practical studies in constructing genealogies, family histories and biographies.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Protected Area Management and Conservation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Protected areas such as national parks and reserves cover around 17% and 7% of the world's land and sea surface respectively and are implemented to conserve or manage biodiversity through the regulation and restriction of human activities. With accelerating rates of species extinctions worldwide, coupled with the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, pressure is growing to designate more protected areas. However, the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity is often questioned, whilst the practical and ethical consequences of restricting human access and resource usage frequently results in conflict between stakeholders. 
This unit allows students to gain a detailed insight into the impacts and effectiveness of terrestrial and marine protected areas, using a case study approach drawing on political ecology to explore the tensions associated with their designation and management. The drivers behind protected area implementation and mechanisms to generate social, economic and environmental benefits for nearby communities will be examined. Students will be expected to make regular and reasoned contributions to class debate, supporting a pedagogical approach based on deep learning and participatory activities.
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to 1) explain and interpret the classification of protected areas and their worldwide distribution; 2) show how political ecology helps identify the drivers behind protected area implementation; 3) compare, contrast and debate the impacts of protected areas on biodiversity and local human communities; 4) critique measures to generate social, economic or environmental benefits from protected areas; 5) judge the viability of the protected area approach to conservation for the 21st century.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Employment relations is fundamental to productive work and is therefore an important aspect of any country's economy and society, but what is 'employment relations'? Is it about unions, about strikes, about negotiation of wages and conditions, about freedom of contract? What happens when a manager wants to introduce some changes or a worker is concerned about safety issues? Why are employment relations good in some companies but not in others? How do systems of employment relations respond to external disruptions? By examining employment relations, work and society, this unit lays the foundations for the study of employment relations and so helps the student to answer questions such as these. The unit discusses the nature of work and the relationship between employer and employee, and considers the role of key actors, that is management, the state and trade unions. It explores areas of conflict and cooperation and the different ways in which conflict can be handled. The unit offers a foundational opportunity to learn about the dynamics of employment relations, and work and the implications for society.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit will emphasise the global impact that Darwin's theory of evolution has had on a range of human endeavours. The unit provides an engaging environment for understanding how evolutionary principles have shaped contemporary human populations and global human endeavours, such as the need to communicate through language, to feed ourselves, fight disease, design our everyday products, conduct business transactions, and fuel our artistic talents. The unit will also explore the darker side of Darwinism, tackling unsettling topics such as ‘scientific racism', colonialism, and the basis for human conflict. In doing so the unit explores the variation in culture and religious belief that is so important in developing an objective understanding of cultural diversity. Students will gain an understanding of how Darwinian principles can be used to help us understand our own actions, but also to respond to some of the biggest challenges facing humankind, including the loss of biodiversity, climate change and disease. Overall, students will gain a broad understanding of what it is to be human, in the context of evolution, in a culturally diverse and environmentally challenged world..</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Climate, Energy and Water Economics</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Without energy or water, our way of life would collapse. Energy use and water availability are closely connected to climate change. How can we make effective decisions as a community about these three interconnected issues? This unit tackles this problem in three modules. Module 1 (energy and climate change) seeks to understand what drives society's demand for energy, how it is affected by energy markets and how energy policies affect greenhouse gas emissions. Module 2 (the economics of climate change) investigates the difficulties of evaluating the economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change and how this affects the effectiveness of climate change policies. Module 3 (water management and policy) seeks to understand what drives water demand and supply, how climate change affects this delicate balance and what policies can help societies adapt to the new climatic conditions. The unit focuses on the economic concepts and tools needed to explain and solve these problems, including supply issues and cost structures, pricing policies, property rights, externalities, cost-benefit analysis and risk management. The unit is a good preparation for those interested in working with electricity, renewable energy or water management agencies, relevant government departments, and industries that intensively use water or energy, such as mining, smelting, transport and power generation. Students will learn much of the content by studying in small groups a set of articles carefully selected according to their specific backgrounds, so that students in each group can complement their understanding using their respective strengths.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The loss and destruction of art objects raises fundamental questions about their functions and value for historians, curators, artists and public alike. From the iconoclastic breaking of images, to the slow decay of neglect, from external impacts of war and looting, to inherent vice (i.e. the intrinsic instability of objects made from perishable or mutable materials like chocolate or wax), this unit examines the impact of loss on the making, the conservation and the study of art. It covers religious, political and aesthetic concepts underpinning the destruction of objects; it explores the material life and memory of the object; and it investigates how artists, curators and scholars alike engage with the temporality of art.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In this unit, students develop their clinical assessment skills particularly in musculoskeletal foot and ankle examinations and to interpret results, differentiate findings and implement patient specific, patient centered management plans with adherence to clinical protocols. Students implement treatments in a 'hand-on' conservative manner in a safe and efficient way to integrate podiatric practice principles and theoretical concepts as part of evidence based management plans which integrate knowledge of anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical presentations, diagnostic and therapeutic principles of conditions commonly affecting the foot and ankle.  Students will engage in experiential learning in a variety of clinical settings, to develop these clinical assessment and manual dexterity skills, to progress their clinical knowledge and to continue development of professional attitudes, behaviours and communication. Students are engage in learning and applying  therapeutic management of podiatric patients. Students apply knowledge of biomechanics to develop their understanding of the human gait cycle as relevant to podiatry practice. Student also apply theories of  orthotic theory, interpretation of biomechanical principles and orthotic design to manage common conditions affecting the foot and ankle, by demonstrate developing psychomotor skills in foot orthoses manufacture. Students also integrate their theoretical understanding of professional behaviour into practice to; promote professionalism, resilience, religious, social and cultural awareness and diversity, to outline some challenges to professionalism, demonstrate objective self-reflection and insight to recognise own personal values, well-being and difficulties and access support services when necessary, and comply with ethical and medicolegal requirements and responsibilities,
Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the experiential work-place learning environments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines competing identities in global politics with a focus on the role of religion. It begins by analysing concepts of identity in the context of globalisation, considering how different global identities are shaped by the interaction between transnationalism and ethnicity. It then examines the resurgence of religion as an issue in international politics in recent decades, looking at the examples of Islam and Christianity.

    <ns1:description>This unit involves intensive study of literary ancient Greek texts in the original language. Students translate the set work(s) independently, thereby developing their command of the language. They perform philological, literary and historical criticism in dialogue with relevant modern scholarship and learn to set the texts in their wider cultural, intellectual, historical and literary contexts. The unit thus prepares students for research in Greek literature and language at postgraduate level.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The law of unjust enrichment has until recently been the forgotten area of private law. It is now firmly entrenched as the third fundamental area of the law of obligations, along with contract and tort. This unit addresses the distinguishing features of this category of claim and its place in the broader private law comprising common law, equity and statute. It examines core areas of the law of unjust enrichment including mistaken payments, duress, failure of consideration and available defences such as change of position. It also critically analyses claims the nature of which have been highly contested, such as undue influence, unconscionable dealing, ‘no intention to benefit' and claims involving public authorities. In so doing, the unit will consider challenging and related concepts such as waiver of tort, tracing and the laws of estoppel. The unit also examines the law of restitution, the gains-based remedy for actions in unjust enrichment and an under-appreciated additional remedy available to other causes of action such as wrongs.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the broad set of roles, activities, contexts and documents that are common to the everyday practice of architecture in Western Australia. Legal, technical, ethical and social issues are addressed alongside the creative and professional enterprise of architects. The stages through which a project progresses are presented in relation to important contractual mechanisms and key concepts of procurement, as well as the participants and stakeholders involved in projects besides the architect: client, consultants, contractors, authorities, building users and the general public. As a way of tangibly illustrating the fundamentals of practice, weekly sessions are framed around a key document that plays an essential role in influencing, regulating and shaping the practice of architecture, its built outcomes, and the communication between participants. The documents include the Project Brief, Client-Architect agreement, Metropolitan Region Scheme, Town Planning Scheme Text and Map, Development Applications and Building Contracts. As well, the National Standard of Competency for Architects is discussed as the core mechanism underpinning the assessment of architectural competence in Australia.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, students will primarily apply knowledge of electronic engineering principles to the design and development of bioinstrumentation. A main focus of the unit will be to combine knowledge of bioinstrumentation with lab-based learning, ensuring students gain practical experience of bioinstrumentation, focussed in the area of biophotonics. Students will take a hands-on approach to explore each step in the development and implementation of bioinstrumentation from the physiological parameter measured and the mechanism used to interpret the measured data, to how the physician uses this information. Key aspects of the unit include: 
1.	A detailed analysis of how light is applied for diagnosis and therapy in bioinstrumentation, including the underlying physics of how light propagates in tissue and how this interaction assists in the treatment of various diseases and medical conditions.
2.	An analysis of biopotentials and how they are used in techniques such as electrocardiography. 
3.	Analogue and digital circuitry used to condition detected biomedical signals.
4.	Core aspects of biomedical signal processing.
5.	A detailed description and analysis of specific bioinstruments, including noise and safety considerations.</ns1:description>

It also encompasses the 'active' component of the research project—the laboratory work, interviews, measurement, field work etc. It is assessed formatively on the basis of the draft Introduction and Methods sections of the dissertation. 
Parts 2, 3 and 4 are the application and iterative refinement of the plan developed in APHB4002 Research Design and Analysis Part 1 for analysis of data gathered from the experimental phase of the research project and development of an interpretative discussion of the findings. It is conducted under the guidance of the supervisor and with feedback provided in the final seminar presented in the APHB4008 Scientific Communication. It culminates in the submission of the completed dissertation for evaluation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is a study of one of the great works of world literature, Dante's Divine Comedy. The unit focusses on the structure of the work and the nature and meaning of Dante's journey through the otherworld. From the first line, Dante states that his individual journey is actually the universal journey of the human condition. Though it is now 700 years since the Comedy was completed, interest in Dante continues to grow. The unit will analyse what this medieval masterpiece, so deeply rooted in the Italy of Dante's own time, has to say that appeals to modern readers. The focus will be on the themes of good and evil; suffering, justice and mercy; Church and State; freedom and desire; and how Dante finds poetic expression for the deepest questions that are part of the human condition.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Contemporary Art and Tradition in China</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit takes place in China. It will equip you with some of the knowledge and skills necessary to engaging with Chinese artists and the booming Chinese artworld. Since 2000, a network of artists, curators, galleries, museums and scholars have created a massive wave of new art in China, both traditional and contemporary. As part of this unit we will visit and experience a traditional art school that specialises in calligraphy, landscape painting and stamp making. Here we will attend a symposium on Chinese art. We will also visit more radical, contemporary artists in their studios in the 798 and Caochangdicun districts of Beijing. 
Students will be able to meet scholars and artists as part of their time in China, and learn some of the skills to undertaking ethnographic research in difficult, cross-cultural conditions. More broadly, knowing both the traditional and contemporary sides of art practice in China will give the skills to navigate the very specific cultural conditions for artists working there today. Such knowledge is of crucial importance for students interested in making connections into China.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Fundamentals of Business Analytics</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Business leaders equipped with the analytical skills needed to extract meaning from complex data sets, and translate this meaning into actionable insights, are highly sought after in the global workplace. To inform strategic decisions, and remain competitive, businesses must leverage the insights contained in the large volumes of data produced both within the business and in the broader business environment. One of the benefits of data analytics is the ability to collate and fuse multiple streams of secondary data, many passively collected, in order to better understand business processes, customer demands, relationships between multiple agents. 
This foundation unit provides the fundamental skills needed to progress in data analytics. Students are able to identify business opportunities where quantitative analysis is beneficial, gain practical experience in the use of different sophisticated analytical tools and techniques (such as R, Python, STATA, SAS, Tableau), identify appropriate analytical methods (such as predictive modelling, simulation, optimisation, clustering and pattern recognition) for business situations, communicate analytical findings in a non-technical way, and translate these findings into business actions. 
Topics include data integrity, data visualisation, predictive modelling, classification (logistic regression, ANN, random forest), clustering (k-means), forecasting, discrete event and generic simulation, and optimisation.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Utopia/Disaster and Imagining the City</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Cities have long provided a means for thinking about human identity, society and values. Likewise, the destruction of cities through various means, the consequence of divine wrath or human frailty, has given historical and narrative form to diverse and often opposing values governing ethical conduct and the virtuous life, individual desires and collective responsibilities. We need to look no further than our television screens and cinemas of late to see that this is true. The destruction of cities depicted in films and real-life events, such as the collapse of the Twin Towers, the bombing of Baghdad and the 2004 tsunami devastation in Southeast Asia, reinforce the immensity of human suffering accompanying such disasters. This option unit considers how films, along with other philosophical and literary sources, serve as vehicles for questioning our seemingly precarious relationship with nature and expose fears for our common urban future. The unit draws on longstanding traditions, particularly from biblical, allegorical and Victorian sources, for moralising about fallen cities, but casts this phenomenon as uniquely modern, emblematic of contemporary concerns for the environment and the means we adopt, technical and urban, for living with it.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA)</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The Assessment for Graduate Teaching (AfGT) is an approved Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA) instrument, endorsed by The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL), which was developed and implemented by a consortium of Australian higher education providers that have Initial Teacher Education (ITE) faculties or schools. The AfGT is designed to capture the sophisticated intellectual work of teaching and enable pre-service teachers to demonstrate the various ways in which they can meet the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (Graduate level). The AfGT is a culminating assessment of teacher performance, employing multiple measures to evaluate a pre-service teacher's teaching and professional decision making. The AfGT assesses most, but not all, of the Australian Professional Standard for Teachers. 
The Assessment for Graduate Teachers (AfGT) is a summative, capstone teaching performance assessment. It is designed to assess a Pre- Service Teacher's (PST) teaching as measured by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at Graduate level (AITSL, 2018). It has been developed as a final-year teaching performance assessment prior to graduation to: 
a) be a reflection of classroom teaching practice including the elements of planning, teaching, assessing and reflecting 
b) be a valid assessment that clearly assesses the content of the Graduate Teacher Standards 
c) have clear, measurable and justifiable achievement criteria that discriminate between meeting and not meeting the Graduate Teacher Standards 
d) be a reliable assessment in which there are appropriate processes in place for ensuring consistent scoring between assessors 
e) include moderation processes that support consistent decision-making against the achievement criteria. 
The summative, capstone nature of the AfGT implies that it is dependent upon successful completion of all other units comprising the pre- service teacher's initial teacher education (ITE) program. This includes the successful completion of the final professional experience placement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores the intersections between law, policy and governance from both theoretical and practical perspectives. First, it examines the meaning of governance, with a focus on the concept of ‘good governance'; key issues and debates associated with the law and governance; and distinctions between governance and government. Second, it explores the development of policy and its translation into law, the differences and relationships between policy and law, how they are formed and who forms them, and the often contested interests and stakeholders involved. Third, the unit considers the processes and pragmatic intricacies of statutory law formation and reform, including through the work of government policy officers, Parliamentary committees and law reform agencies. Fourth, the practical application of law, policy and governance is analysed, providing an opportunity to assess effectiveness in contemporary case study areas.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Global Environmental Politics</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit looks at crucial global environmental issues, how they have emerged, and how they might be dealt with by policy-makers. The unit first looks briefly at theories of environmental politics, using concepts from international relations, global governance and policy studies, to ask how should we think about the planet and its politics. It then looks at key actors, including states, intergovernmental organisations, transnational corporations and social movements, and how these actors clash to produce political and environmental outcomes. The unit concludes by looking at several case studies of how environmental issues arise, how different actors inform governance and wield authority, what policy solutions might look like, and how political interests prevent them from being implemented. Case studies include the militarization of the Himalayan watershed, intergovernmental climate change agreements, resource extraction in Southern Africa, the governance of the Arctic and Antarctic, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and the global coal industry's struggle for survival. Students will learn how global environmental crises arise, why they are mismanaged, and how they can be best be reckoned with.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Russia's twentieth century was a history of extremes. At its beginning, Europe's last great aristocratic autocracy was violently overthrown by a series of revolutions, the last of which purported to be the harbinger of the paradise of world communism. A brutal civil war marked the beginning of the planet's first experiment in socialist state power. Lenin's early death witnessed the ascendancy of Stalin and the ruthless imposition of his own revolution from above: collectivisation, breakneck industrialisation and mass terror paved the way for the coming into being of a Soviet Union capable, through the sacrifice of millions of more Soviet lives, of meeting and defeating the exterminatory war unleashed by the Nazis on Russia and the world. Emerging from that conflict as a global superpower, the Soviet Union, expanded to an empire spanning now from Berlin to Japan, locked horns for planetary supremacy with the USA. Communism survived Stalin's death in 1953, and sought to keep pace internally and externally. Matching its rival in nuclear weaponry and in the space-race, as well as in policing its sprawling empire, Russia under Khrushchev and Brezhnev gradually fell behind in the battle for the hearts and minds of its citizens and the world. By the 1980s the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe emphatically symbolised the Soviet Union's redundancy. Under Gorbachev, reform aimed at salvaging the salvageable spiralled out of control and between 1989 and 1991 the Soviet Union first lost its empire and then imploded. The entity emerging from the wreckage of so many dreams and disasters struggled to find its way. Putin's rise to power in the last years of the twentieth century opened up yet another dramatic chapter in this nation's extraordinarily fraught history. Through engagement with and analysis of a broad range of documents, histories, debates and historiography, this unit surveys Russia's awe-inspiring, tragic and brutal twentieth century.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Conservation in Cultural Landscapes, Historic Towns and Urban Precincts</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces three international concepts in conservation: cultural landscapes, historic towns, and urban conservation areas. It investigates the processes of identification, assessment, and management of cultural significance in a range of places from world to local level. Cultural landscape is an emerging concept in conservation. In  Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention,  the term 'cultural landscape' embraces 'diverse demonstrations of the interaction between humankind and its natural environment …illustrative of the evolution of human society and settlement over time (UNESCO 2008).'  Following on from the  Hoi An Protocols for Best Conservation Practice in Asia,  the assessment of cultural landscapes increasingly involves engaging with living cultural traditions, and recognises the value of existing and traditional stakeholders and land users in managing significance (UNESCO 2009). The concepts of historic towns and urban conservation areas have a longer history and focus on places with historic, social and townscape values that contribute to a strong sense of place and cultural identity. Through a range of case studies from the World Heritage List to the local Western Australian context, students examine the ways such places have been assessed, recorded and protected, and the levels of conservation planning that have been applied to them.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Students commence an appropriately designed research project in an area of interest, under the supervision of a UWA Rural Clinical School academic staff member. In addition to commencing their research project, students prepare a literature review and a written research proposal where they place their study in the context of the available literature, formulate one or more hypotheses or research questions based on gaps in the available knowledge, design an appropriate research study to test their hypotheses or answer their research questions, and outline their study design, research methods and data analysis plan.
The project can be one of either clinical audit, systematic review, or independent research. The first assessment will be a wriitten assigment which may include a formal research proposal (including literature review) and/or submission to Human Research Ethics Committee, GEKO, or PROSPERO. 
Students planning on undertaking research Masters or PhD programs in the future are advised to undertake independent research.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Over the last decade there has been an exponential increase in the volume of data available to organisations. At the same time, there have been substantial improvements to the tools used to extract meaning from data. Data literacy is the ability to collect, process, and extract meaning from data, and in doing so, convert data to actionable insights. Improved data literacy is needed to make better sense of the huge volumes of data available to organisations and consequently to make better data-driven business decisions to enable business success. This unit provides students with the ability to understand data quality issues, discern good from poor data, identify appropriate analytical tools and techniques for business problems, make meaning from data, and visualise and communicate findings to a non-technical audience.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, students gain an appreciation for the requirement of evidence based medicine and practice. This unit aims to prepare the graduate with the appropriate skills to systematically inform themselves and their patients of developing evidence based medicine using scientific methods. Students develop strong research, critiquing, referencing skills medical research design, evidence and association and statistical analyses and are able to discuss National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) levels of evidence and elements of the Helsinki agreement &amp; NHMRC requirements related to animal welfare and human research ethics for research. Students identify requirements and write a research plan, and determine resources and funding sources for a given research project.   Students develop their literature review skills by performing a critical analysis of the research papers and identify the strengths and weaknesses of research designs. Students gain expertise in using online information resources and managing references.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from INDO1403 Indonesian 3 or INDO2403 Indonesian 3 and leads to INDO2405 Indonesian 5 or INDO3405 Indonesian 5. It develops 'basic social proficiency' in both formal and informal Indonesian or Level 2 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). Using a variety of text types, students develop their ability to discuss daily life in Australia and Indonesia, focusing on Indonesian society and culture. They widen their vocabulary and their understanding of sophisticated linguistic structures. Students are introduced to the conventions of informal speech in Indonesian, using largely video material from Indonesian films and television but also youth magazines. Their writing skills are also further developed through essay writing exercises. They are expected to be able to operate relatively capably in social situations in Indonesia, demonstrating comprehension of formal and informal speech in Indonesian, providing information and expressing opinions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit develops a patient-centred approach to the investigation and management of common foot pathologies of the forefoot, mid-foot and rearfoot. Students undertake advanced tuition in the selection of elective podiatric surgical procedures, the principles of internal fixation and post-operative care of the surgical patient. The diagnosis and management of post-operative complications is considered in a multidisciplinary context. 
The unit gives students understanding of the scope of surgical podiatry in the Australian context by strategic podiatric clinical and surgical placements and hospital rotations. Students observe the appropriate selection of surgical procedures, observe operative procedures and perioperative patient management and are instructed in basic wound biopsy, wound closure and below-knee immobilisation techniques. The unit involves introductory podiatric surgery practical experience within the UWA Podiatry Clinic and selected clinical and surgical placements under the supervision of an academic staff member or designate. Theoretical instruction in selected forefoot and soft-tissue procedures, wound biopsy, suture and below-knee casting techniques is undertaken.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, science, clinical and professional content will be presented longitudinally, built around core clinical conditions and presentations that illustrate the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences and the cardiovascular system. 
Students will cover the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, anatomical pathology and pharmacology. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and clinical skills of medical history-taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours, understanding of patient perspectives and requirements of patient-centred care. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are reinforced along with the opportunity to discuss social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics in the clinical context. Students have opportunities to develop their information literacy skills as applied to medicine. Students will continue to develop professional aspects of medical practice including professional behaviours, medical law and ethics, leadership and teamwork, collaborative practice, educational theory and practice, diversity within medicine, and Aboriginal health.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Myths of the Greeks and Romans: Story, History and Reinvention</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Greek myth, adopted by the Romans, dominated classical literature, art and religion, providing the basis of a cultural unity which spread across continents and millennia and still continues to provide a shared intellectual background around the globe. This unit begins from early creation myths and examines the development of Greek and Roman myth in this literature and art, exploring the development of many famous myths such as those of the Golden Fleece and of the Trojan war. Various modern attempts to explain myth are examined including the complicated relationship between myth and history: how far can we use the former to reconstruct the latter? Finally, the unit looks at some of the rich history of classical myth's reception by later ages and cultures, including our own, and its continuing influence on our cultural landscape.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Human Inequality in the Anthropocene</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Inequality within and between nation states has never been greater, and in many places, is on the rise. This results in greater political instability and social unrest, and among other things, impedes the poorest in society in building resilience and adaptive capacity in the face of global crises such as pandemics and the far-reaching impacts of global environmental change. It also presents challenges to our ability to advance just and equitable long-term national and regional developmental trajectories and design effective policy responses to global crises. But how did the world come to be in this state? 
	This unit equips students with a conceptual toolkit of critical reasoning and analytical skills with which to understand the spatially uneven nature of development across time, and at a range of scales. It takes a geographical approach to examining the relationship between historical, economic, demographic, political and environmental processes, and the social and spatial structures through which inequalities are produced and sustained. Viewed from the perspective of interdependent national and regional economies and processes of population change (fertility, mortality and migration), the unit focusses on restructuring spatial divisions of labour, access to and exploitation of natural resources, global systems of trade, and entrenched drivers of poverty, to consider how the lives of the wealthy and poor are entwined through both local and globally interdependent systems, and the implications of these systems for the world's ecosystems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the concept that climate change can drive the evolution of biological diversity. It aims to explain the atmospheric processes that regulate the Earth's climate; the role of climate change in the evolution of the world's ecosystems; the human-induced changes that are occurring in the atmosphere; how these changes affect the global climate which in turn affects biodiversity; and the challenges of biodiversity conservation under climate change. Emphasis is placed on understanding the links between the atmosphere, climate and the world's ecosystems; how changes in climate can force species losses, migration and adaptation; what can be learned from vegetation response to past climate changes; the predicted impacts to biological diversity under projected greenhouse climates; and the conservation efforts that are required to mitigate these impacts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Social Work and Mental Health Practice has been developed to comply with the Australian Association of Social Workers Mental Health Competencies (2014) and the National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce (2013). The Australian Association of Social Workers Mental Health Competencies (2014) and National Practice Standards for the Mental Health Workforce (2013) documents provides the broad framework for this series of lecture/seminars. The purpose of social work practice in mental health is to assist to restore individual, family, and community well-being, and to promote principles of social justice. Social works clinical practice occurs at the interface between the individual and the environment; social work activity begins with the individual, and extends to the contexts of family, social networks, community, and the broader society.
This unit will examine the two important aspects governing clinical practice in a mental health context. This will include theoretical modalities (knowledge, models of understanding), and clinical intervention strategies (techniques, therapeutic modalities). All the theoretical models examined, where possible, will be evidenced based practice models (EBPs).
The philosophical framework governing this unit from the mental health perspective is the biopsychosocial model, which consciously attempts to incorporate all of the significant dimensions in human existence in order to optimally conceptualise our understanding of the human condition in general and mental health issues specifically.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the principles, methods, and applications of curatorial practice. Practical skills such as marketing, budgeting, grant writing and information distribution will be developed and the roles of sponsorship, philanthropy and exhibition coordination will be examined. Key themes include the roles and responsibilities of institutional-based gallery exhibitions, the use of alternative and non-gallery based exhibition spaces, exhibition design, and the dynamics and social relations that shape the context of curatorial practice. Students are given an opportunity to discuss emergent issues, explore practical methods, grapple with theoretical problems and form arguments through written and applied research. This unit will be partly taught in art organisations within the museum and gallery sector so that students can acquire an experiential grounding in the processes and practices of curating with particular reference to the Australian context. Curatorial Practice is a core unit for students enrolled in the Fine Arts Major.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This is an introductory unit that explores prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structure and function at the physiological and molecular levels. A strong emphasis is placed on applications in biomedicine and biotechnology. The unit builds on concepts introduced in BIOL1130 Frontiers in Biology (formerly BIOL1130 Core Concepts in Biology) and ANHB1101 Human Biology I: Becoming Human. The first part of the unit covers DNA, RNA and protein structure, DNA replication, gene expression and its regulation, and recombinant DNA technology. The second part of the unit deals with the cell cycle and cell differentiation, cell structure and compartmentation, the structure of biological membranes and strategies used to move molecules across these membranes, and intercellular communication. Applications of cell and molecular biology in microbiology, disease diagnosis and therapy, and genetic engineering are discussed in the final part of the unit. Practical classes illustrate fundamental techniques in cell and molecular biology.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit pre-service teachers undertake a formal honours project. The research project extends their knowledge of curriculum and pedagogy in their chosen Primary Specialisation. This is an action research project that investigates and reports on a planned intervention in an educational setting. The objective of this unit is to develop pre-service teachers' understanding of the research process, to develop their capacity to conduct independent research in a school-setting, to build their skills in identifying areas for improvement in professional practice, use and reflect on an appropriate methodology, analyse results and use evidence to make decisions and design, manage and complete a dissertation that meets all scholarly and ethical standards. This is a supervised action research project that will be examined by two independent academics. It is expected that no more than 5 days in schools is required to undertake the necessary research activities. Students are strongly encouraged to contact and meet with (virtually or in person) their supervisor/s at least once/fortnight. Class drop-in sessions are scheduled via Teams to provide further support and advice. The dissertation project aligns with Level 8 TEQSA criteria.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Cultural change has often been in tandem with progress in the development of art and science, and in particular, of mathematics. This unit examines some of the many influences of mathematics on abstract thought, conceptions of reality, the nature of truth and valid argument, and the development of science and technology. In everyday life, there are paradoxes and counter-intuitive phenomena that are best explained by mathematics, and we endeavour to take a journey that will explore the power of modern mathematical thinking in the modern world. Topics include: Renaissance mathematics, and in particular, the mathematics developed to understand graphical perspective in art; classical game theory; combinatorial game theory and network models; cryptography; correlation and causation. This unit assumes the student has little or no mathematical background.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The focus of this unit is the matching of livestock energy demand to supply of feed, particularly forage, within Australian agricultural systems. Pasture production is first focused upon with an emphasis on the ecology of the major pasture legumes and grasses, especially in a Mediterranean climate, as is typical of Western Australia. Breeding of annual pasture legumes is examined. The ruminant digestive system and reproductive cycle are explored along with the factors that determine diet, feed quality and feed intake.  Current challenges and innovations in livestock systems, including in the rangelands of Western Australia, are explored in lectures and through visiting the UWA Future Farm and Shenton Park Research Station (e.g. saltland pastures, perennial native shrubs, novel annual pasture legumes, legume breeding, oestrogenic pastures and low stress livestock handling).  Laboratories are used to explore key concepts in more detail and the skills needed to design experiments and collect and explore data using Excel and the statistical package R are emphasised throughout the unit.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit gives students the opportunity to gain in-depth experience in an aspect of archaeology-related fieldwork. Students can flexibly decide which fieldwork aspect they want to pursue within this unit. The project can be related to archaeological fieldwork, rock art or museum- or collection-based research. For this unit, students can also participate in the supervised rock art recording and archaeological excavation project run by UWA's Centre for Rock Art Research + Management in partnership with Rio Tinto's Cultural Heritage team and Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and Rangers. The partnership is part of Rio Tinto's contributions under their Conservation Agreement for the National Heritage Listing of the Burrup Peninsula. The unit provides students with a unique opportunity to develop practical and conceptual skills across different aspects of archaeological fieldwork as well as recording and interpretation methods. In this way, students can gain insights into a particular area of archaeological field research such as Indigenous or historical archaeology, collections-based or rock art research. The final report is an output that can be listed on the student's professional CV.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice I Part 2</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the first-year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics  Clinic Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:

    <ns1:description>Data is ubiquitous in modern society. It is used to monitor the economy, inform business decisions, understand how the environment is changing, and communicate public health messages. Data science is a booming field that harnesses raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge. Data Scientists develop and employ tools to collect, understand and communicate data and its meaning. They are able to identify trends, understand demographics and  inform interventions. They are able to work across disciplines, from science to business, health, media and politics. But data can also be misused, and a professional Data Scientist will understand the ethical demands of responsible use of data. This hands-on unit provides practical experience, using the programming language Python, for solving real-world data science problems, from acquiring data from public sources, to understanding the data through analysis and modelling, to visualising and presenting the results.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Professionalism in Action Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Professionalism in pharmacy goes beyond having the adequate knowledge and skills needed to be a competent pharmacist. Being a professional requires professional stewardship, continuous self-reflection, and a lifelong commitment to the patients and the communities one serves. This unit was created in recognition that students need more exposure to experiences that support them in their journey to become professionals who are able to skillfully enact positive change for the betterment of the wider community. In order to provide the highest quality, equitable healthcare to all patients, health professionals of the present and future eras will need to collaborate with other disciplines, as well as master all facets of one's discipline. 
This unit therefore has two foci: (1) proactive immersion in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse/Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, industry, and interprofessional activities; and (2) utilisation of existing discipline knowledge and skills to create meaningful projects that meet the needs of a defined community (student, profession, patient, or public). Unlike more traditional units of study which are teacher-led, this unit is intended to be student-led, whereby students have significant freedom, flexibility, and self-direction in their learning, with academic guidance to support attainment of the unit's intended learning outcomes.
In this unit, students will have the opportunity to find, select, undertake, and reflect on activities from broad, pre-defined areas  (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse/Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, industry, and interprofessional). Students will also identify, design, conduct, and evaluate a real-world project in partnership with self-selected community partners. Students will learn primarily through active participation, self-directed learning, and (self) reflection. Collectively, the intent of this unit is to support students in becoming pro-active, safe, and socially accountable leaders, citizens, and health professionals.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Through studies of the relationship between technology and design, this unit presents various construction systems and building materials. By using a methodological analysis based on analytical drawings/diagrams, the unit teaches the act of drawing by hand as a way of thinking as well as a mode of representation. The analytical drawings aim to reveal the underlying patterns of organisation that exist within buildings (e.g. structure, services, envelope) in order to highlight the relationship between architectural design and construction systems.

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">0</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on physical disasters including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, epidemics, and those related to climate change including fires, droughts and floods. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the environmental, physical and geological and social triggers of these events from an environmental science viewpoint and the social vulnerabilities and failures that, together, result in slowly unfolding disasters or rapid-onset catastrophic events. The unit uses a variety of domestic and international case studies to examine how, in each case, physical vulnerabilities, environmental hazards and risk management intersect to produce disasters that threaten lives, livelihoods and ecosystems across a range of biophysical and socioeconomic contexts and scales. 
The unit is delivered via a one-hour lecture each week which focuses on overarching themes and concepts that are further explored through a three-hour tutorial each week. The concepts include vulnerability, hazards and governance as understood through physical geography and human geography. Students apply these concepts through an investigation of a real-world disaster in tutorials to unravel the layers of complex interactions that result in disasters. Tutorials are designed with a strong emphasis on practical and group work to foster skills in multi-layered analytical thinking that encompasses patterns, processes and interactions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit uses the discussion and analysis of recent German cultural productions such as advertisements, film, literature and music as the basis for language acquisition. Class discussion focuses mainly on the examination of contemporary film as well as of other visual art and culture, on their links to current sociopolitical issues and their connections to wider cultural phenomena. This research-intensive part of the unit covers a broad range of historical and theoretical issues. The language component fosters and deepens the knowledge of contemporary German language usage and reinforces grammatical structures by utilising materials from the lecture. The unit consolidates and improves the language ability of learners of German at an intermediate level with a research-intensive approach. It also develops cultural and linguistic awareness and improves students' communication skills and knowledge of and about language, in the target language as well as in English. 
Students gain an increased level of competency in all four macro skills—listening to, speaking, reading and writing German corresponding to Levels A2/B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen). Students develop an increased awareness of intercultural understanding and of language learning, as well as research skills and communication strategies and increased awareness of how languages work in general.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Tracking the shifting notion of both the citizen and the 'self', this unit explores the complex history of the nineteenth century through the lens of the portrait. By analysing visual representations and their social reception, the unit employs portraiture as both a fulcrum and foil for understanding the role of the individual in nineteenth century society. How does portraiture respond to political and cultural changes? Who is portrayed and for what audience? What is the role of the 'real' in portraiture of the nineteenth century? Implicit in this analysis is a consideration of the artist-as-individual and the personal and political stakes of self-portraiture. The nineteenth century witnessed a dramatic change in the reception and creation of portraits; by analysing the self as the subject, observer and producer of images, the unit explores how the individual evolved from an Enlightenment ideal to a 'modern subject' over the course of the nineteenth century.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Literary history is the story of rebellion against literary conventions, social injustices, and indeed what has counted from one age to another as literature.  This unit proposes to introduce students to this fundamental feature of literary history by identifying and analysing the roles texts have in registering and challenging multiple ideas of rebellion.  In this unit, students will engage with an exciting range of provocative texts from various historical periods, genres and social and philosophical contexts to come to a deeper understanding of how texts might represent and question political, social and aesthetic authority, and contribute to changing how we know the world, ourselves and others.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Artists are increasingly working with living systems as a palette for making art (BioArt). This unit provides the basic practical and theoretical working methodologies for the growth, construction and care of works of art that include living elements. Students will investigate the basic techniques of growing and manipulating living materials and organisms for cultural expression. In this unit, the biological laboratory will function as the artist's studio so that students can experience ‘hands-on' engagement with the interaction between art and biology. Additionally, students are expected to interrogate and reflect upon the ethical, political and aesthetic issues of living art. This is the first unit in the art and biotechnologies specialisation for students enrolled in the Fine Arts major.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Quantum computation is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field, which has attracted researchers from physics, computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and electronic engineering.  Instead of brute-force miniaturization of basic electronic components, quantum computation utilizes entirely new design architecture and promises to solve problems that are intractable on conventional computers. It offers the prospect of harnessing nature at a much deeper level than ever before, providing a wealth of new possibilities for information processing, numerical simulation, and secure communication.
In this unit, students will learn about (1) Fundamentals of quantum computing: historical development of computational tools, power of quantum superposition and parallelism, quantum bits and state vectors, quantum circuits and unitary operators, universal quantum computation; (2) Quantum algorithms: Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's algorithm for integer factorization, quantum Fourier transform and its properties, quantum phase estimation and finding eigenvalues, Grover's search algorithm, quantum amplitude amplification and estimation, quantum optimisation; (3) Quantum errors: cause and effect, quantum error correction, quantum fault-tolerant computation; (4) Quantum Information: quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, quantum bit commitment, and quantum communication.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Around the world many marine fish stocks are either fully exploited or over exploited with a global trend of declining catch. These declines are causing concern about the effectiveness of fisheries management practices with alternative strategies, such as the implementation of large no-take sanctuary zones being promoted and trialled. In this unit students learn about goals of fisheries management and marine conservation and about the outcomes and effectiveness of global and local management strategies. They learn about the policy framework that fisheries management and marine conservation operates under in Western Australia and meet with a range of Western Australian stakeholders to hear about their concerns and visions for the future management of Western Australia's marine resources. One of the key questions which needs to be addressed is whether these visions and management strategies will work for key Western Australian species. The unit allows students to integrate knowledge of both marine conservation and fisheries management. The contacts and knowledge gained through the unit provide students the opportunities to pursue a career in marine natural resource management.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Politics is about power. Political science is the systematic study of how humans organise to exercise and contest power. This unit will introduce you to the approaches political scientists use to understand how power operates in modern and contemporary politics.  
By the end of this unit you will be well-prepared to continue the study of national and international politics - and other social science topics (including sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, history, business). Most importantly, you will better understand the key actors, and institutions that shape nations, communities, neighbourhoods, families, and your daily life. This unit does not teach you what to think about politics, it gives you the conceptual tools to evaluate and develop your own critical thinking about politics and power.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Stars undergo a life cycle starting as proto-stars forming from clouds of gas and dust, though main- and post-main-sequence stars with active nuclear fusion in their cores, to their final state as white dwarfs, supernovae, neutron stars and/or black holes.  Understanding these stellar-mass objects and their life cycle is a frontier area of astrophysics research, and their observational study utilises techniques and facilities at the frontiers of astronomy.  
In this unit, students will learn about (1) the astrophysics of stellar evolution, stellar objects and black holes; and (2) the astronomy techniques used to observe these and other systems.  Regarding stellar-mass objects, topics covered will include the stellar birth and evolution; nuclear fusion in stellar cores; stellar structure; degeneracy pressure; white dwarfs, neutron stars and pulsar; supernovae, accretion physics; the theorised and observed physical characteristics of stellar-mass black holes; and tests of general relativity using binary neutron stars and black holes.  Regarding astronomy techniques, topics covered will include radiative processes in astrophysics; modern optical and radio-astronomy techniques, and gravitational astronomy using gravity-wave detectors.  Students will conduct an individual astronomy project using advanced robotic telescopes to study stellar-mass objects, and a class-based project  on muon physics which offers the potential to test relativistic effects such as time dilation using cosmic rays generated by stellar astrophysical processes.
The final part of the unit is an individual research assignment culminating in a draft scientific paper in a form suitable for submission to a refereed journal.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the practical application of the principles of evidence-based medicine to clinical practice in emergency and acute care clinical settings. Evidence-based medicine is "the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values". Through the use of case-based scenarios, participants develop the knowledge and skills to effectively and critically appraise research papers relating to care in a clinical context, including the ability to decide on the applicability of the evidence to address a specific clinical question. The emphasis is on the incorporation of scientific evidence into individualised patient care. Students are encouraged to address clinical questions applicable to their specific clinical context. 
The content of the unit includes (1) asking answerable questions relating to clinical practice in emergency care; (2) finding the evidence; (3) managing information resources efficiently; (4) critical appraisal of research papers addressing different types of clinical questions in emergency care; (5) translation of the research evidence into practice; and (6) critical consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the 'evidence-based medicine' paradigm in emergency care practice.</ns1:description>

In an age of photorealistic rendering and virtual reality how might we interpret the complex history of architectural representation to inform and propose novel forms of architectural imaginary and new sites of architectural speculation?
This unit offers the opportunity for in-depth explorations of the specialised material that constitutes the very particular history of architectural production. Through seminar-based, student-lead presentations and discussion the unit interrogates the context, histories and theories that surround canonical drawings, models and treatises from medieval notebooks to the datascaping and diagramming of the late twentieth century. How might an understanding of these histories be synthesised into new ways of thinking about drawing into the future? 
This unit is one of a number of options in the Masters of Architecture that has a differing and complementary focus on drawing. In this unit students investigate the subject matter via two means–the construction of analytical and critical drawings about existing architectural drawings as well as the written exploration of these drawings.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In Audit and Risk, students develop knowledge and skills required for applying professional judgement and professional scepticism in addressing risk in auditing areas where significant professional judgement is required in the context of the audit of general purpose financial statements. The ability to integrate practical and technical skills in the audit of financial statements is an essential skill for Chartered Accountants. Students are equipped with skills for identifying and assessing risks and controls while taking into consideration the broad impact of changes in an entity and its environment. The activities and assessments simulate real-world audit experiences and challenges faced during planning, performing and concluding an audit of financial statements. Communication and collaboration skills will be developed based on simulated interactions with a variety of stakeholders to achieve audit objectives.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is concerned with studying the qualitative and quantitative aspects of nutrition required for people of different ages and physical activities. It deals with the digestion and absorption of macronutrients and micronutrients, and how this is coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems. It also considers genetic mutations that deal with inappropriate nutrient absorption (lactose intolerance and cystic fibrosis). A detailed analysis of the absorbed nutrients, their assimilation and subsequent metabolism are considered. The role of the endocrine system in metabolic assimilation of absorbed fuel, along with derangements that follow their excess consumption are considered (e.g. metabolic acidosis, metabolic syndrome). Generic components of these endocrine systems responsible for signal transduction that maintain homeostasis are highlighted by examples that use inherited disorders. The neural and endocrine control of appetite and strategies used to manage this are also addressed.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The 1960s witnessed the emergence of genres, styles, composers and performers that changed the western musical landscape. In this unit, students explore some of the important figures, music, and events that defined this decade. Through a series of case studies drawn from a variety of genres and styles, students examine key musical developments, as well as investigate the ways in which music contributed and responded to social and cultural upheavals, and the important role music played in the forging of personal and political identities. Examples of topics of study may include repertoire drawn from European modernism, American and British experimentalism, Jazz, and popular music.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Assessing Environmental Quality</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit gives students a basis for assessing the state of, and human impacts on, various environments. Students learn the different types of pollutants that enter the environment and transport pathways to environmental and human receptors, as well as the potential for attenuation to occur. Natural and agricultural catchments, urban land, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and air quality are discussed. Through case studies, guest lectures from environmental practitioners and a field trip, students will learn the fundamental processes affecting pollutant fate in different environments. Students will also work with practical aspects of environmental quality assessment, including design of sampling programs, analysis of samples, management of data and application of statistical methods for testing hypotheses. The course will result in both a solid grounding in the fundamental controls on pollutant mobility vs attenuation and the practical skills to gather and interpret site-specific data. The result will be a strong basis for formulating conceptual site models, which in turn is key for assessing environmental risk and environmental management.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit examines foreign policy, providing students with foundational theoretical and empirical knowledge and developing critical skills in political and policy analysis. The unit builds directly upon introductory disciplinary study by situating the study and practice of foreign policy in relation to both public policy and international relations. The unit trains students to understand how foreign policy is both constructed and implemented by interrogating key theories, concepts, processes and practices. It examines a range of factors that shape foreign policy, including history, culture, identity, power, ideology, geography, resources and political systems. The unit evaluates the roles and significance of different actors and structures in making, influencing and implementing foreign policy, such as interest groups, the media, political parties, the bureaucracy, the diplomatic corps, alliances, international organisations and the global political economy. To demonstrate the links between theory, policymaking and diplomatic practice in the contemporary international system, the unit explores and compares foreign policy in a range of country case studies including Australia, the US, India, South Africa and Indonesia.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to the social and historical contexts of architecture and building works. It emphasises the instrumental, symbolic and aspirational roles performed by representations of architecture and landscape design, particularly drawings.  The unit contextualises drawings, while introducing notions like the seriality of images, their relation to one another for a given historical period and across time. By means of drawing and writing analyses, students are encouraged to recognise how the designer comes to be a powerful creative agent, largely by means of their mastery of representational systems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This is part 1 of the Design project available within the Master in Geotechnics for Offshore Wind Energy. Parts 1 of and 2 must be completed to satisfy the requirements of the unit. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world offshore geotechnical design challenge. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic geotechnical engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as offshore geotechnical design engineers. The focus of this unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Curating First Nations Art</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>For decades, museums and art galleries around the world have been challenged by First Nations people to reconsider their presentation of Indigenous materials, ideas, concepts and narratives. Since their emergence, these institutions have framed indigenous culture in terms of a white, (post-) colonial narrative. The challenge these institutions face is to build meaningful and respectful relationships with the communities whose cultural materials they have historically benefited from exhibiting and to involve communities in the reshaping of their own narratives.
Through (online) guest lectures by leading (inter) national specialists in the field, local gallery visits and face-to-face curator talks, this unit will address some of the challenges and recent trends in curating First Nations art today in Australia and elsewhere. It will ask questions of whether Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community expectations have been met regarding unequal representation and embedding cultural protocols in museum policy. It will consider the role of the curator in relation to First Nations artists and communities, reflect on Indigenous methodologies in curatorial practice and discuss how to affirm a deeper First Peoples presence in museums and galleries.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Students will have the opportunity to experience first-hand the agricultural and environmental challenges facing Thailand with their learning experiences enriched through lectures delivered by UWA and Thai staff and visits to agricultural stations, rural communities and/or national parks. A ‘buddy system' pairs up Australian with Thai students and all activities are done jointly. Students apply their learning in a setting very different to Australia whilst learning with and from Thai students. Integrated field-work gives students a unique insight into the different socioeconomic and environmental issues facing agriculture in Asia. Students spend one month preparing for their international experience – this includes the development of a non-verbal and non-written laboratory methods manual which the students will teach to their Thai buddies. This is   followed by two intensive weeks (8 hours /day) at Naresuan University, Thailand. On their return students submit a consultancy report on a topic of their choice. The course includes topic-specific study that is supplemented and contextualized by local Thai staff. Field trips plus weekend cultural activities are included.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is an introduction to Ancient Greek for students who have never before studied this language or who have had minimal instruction in it. It introduces students primarily to the changing forms of Greek words (their 'inflected morphology') and in so doing provides a grounding in basic grammar which is of fundamental benefit to English expression (as well as being of great utility for the acquisition of other modern languages). The unit focuses on the form of Greek in ordinary use (hence known as 'Koine', the Greek for 'common') in the first century AD and which was used to write the New Testament. As a simplified form of the Attic Greek written in Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, this is an ideal introduction to the ancient language. It is taught through formal grammar exercises and through the translation of simple extracts from ancient texts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit aims to develop a critical approach to current issues in conservation biology. It examines the following five broad themes: (1) What biodiversity is there? How did it get there (evolutionary history)? Which processes maintain it? (2) Why should we conserve it? (3) What are the threatened genes, species and communities? (4) What are the threatening processes? (5) What actions can be taken to conserve biodiversity? Students are aware of the fundamental linkages between good science and conservation management and the critical engagement between government, universities, business and the community in generating effective conservation outcomes. The unit also introduces students to fundamental science and scientific thinking and approaches to problem solving in ecology, population genetics, species biology and decision theory that underpin modern conservation biology.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The two extended clinical placement units are designed for final year DPM students to prepare the student for entry into the workplace upon graduation as a registered health professional.. This unit builds-on and develops students accumulated clinical experiences, knowledge, skills and behaviours which have been curated through the clinical podiatric practice units via experiential work-integrated learning. Students consolidate clinical reasoning, knowledge, skills and professional attributes acquired across the course during these placements. Students consolidate professional identity, undertaking the role of the professional, ethical practitioner, the advocate, the educator, the researcher, the team member and leader by delivering exemplary patient-centered care. Students develop the capacity to perform effective reflective practice and an appreciation of social determinants of health, foot health needs in the community, and the professional role and responsibilities of podiatrists in the community, and therefore form the basis for lifelong learning in professional practice, while consolidating knowledge and skills acquired across the course.  Students will experience team work and collaboration with a range of health professionals in an interdisciplinary environment. Students consolidate learning and application of therapeutic management of patients by integrating patient history and clinical examination findings, patient context and treatment factors, to determine appropriate prescribed medicines.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the way standards of public accountability and social responsibility are articulated, shaped and circulated by media practices in contemporary society. It also examines the roles of the media in exposing failures in public responsibility and accountability in a variety of professional and cultural contexts and explores new relationships of power emerging out of the use of social media.   The unit also explores the responsibility of the media itself, and the complex issues associated with holding the media to account. The case studies consider the way accountability is presented, and advocated for, in moments of scandal, crisis and corruption. Instances of social media shaming, social movement media, and corporate social responsibility are discussed in the contexts of considering how ideas about public responsibility and accountability are being redefined.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Building upon the content of LAWS4108 Foundations of Public Law, students engage in a detailed study of Commonwealth Constitution High Court jurisprudence. Introducing constitutional characterisation through the Trade and Commerce Power, they then focus on an analysis of key Commonwealth powers, namely the Corporations, External Affairs, Defence, Finance and Referral powers. Subsequently, students consider the restraints on powers such as Chapter III judicial power, the implied freedom of political communication, intergovernmental immunities and inconsistency of Commonwealth and State laws. Topics draw upon contemporary, historical and political developments and policy background to expound the High Court's role as the constitutional keystone of the Australian federation and its interpretive influence over Commonwealth-State relations. Students are able to (1) demonstrate a sound understanding of constitutional powers and their limits, while appreciating institutional relationships, the impact of constitutional decisions and contemporary constitutional developments; (2) appreciate how constitutional litigation is conducted; (3) develop and apply constitutional methodology and analysis to constitutional problems; (4) locate, digest, critique, synthesise and apply constitutional materials; and (5) confidently discuss constitutional concepts and formulate logical constitutional arguments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The focus of this unit is on grazing systems that produce healthy animals and high quality products using the principles of clean, green and ethical animal production. Topics include the efficiency of feed utilisation, matching feed supply to animal needs to improve reproductive efficiency, benefits of plant diversity and how grazing behaviour and learned responses of animals can be used to manage diversity. There is a focus on the ability of grazing systems to be profitable but also contribute to healthy landscapes through the use of novel plants to improve water use, nutrient flows and soil erosion, and animal health through the provision of shade, shelter, control of gastrointestinal nematodes and reduced methane production for livestock. The unit consists of three blocks of two-day sessions (including a field trip to the UWA Future Farm at Pingelly). This unit is essential for all students interested in a career in agricultural science, meeting the challenge of developing profitable production systems and managing risk in the face of increased climate variability. It is also relevant for students with an interest in natural resource management.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Environmental Engineering problems are complex and challenging, with modelling approaches typically playing a central role in evaluation of solutions. Modelling complex environmental systems is thus a core skill of professional Environmental Engineers. This modelling may be analytical, physical, numerical or empirical in nature. This unit introduces students to the modelling process in Environmental Engineering. Models will be developed to understand how a wide range of environmental systems (atmospheric, marine/coastal, hydrological and urban water systems) function and respond to perturbation. 
Students work through the modelling process in Environmental Engineering including: model conceptualization; choosing between modelling approaches of various complexities; model construction, including in a numerical programming environment; model calibration and validation; assessment of model uncertainty and sensitivity; critical evaluation of model output; and communication of modelling results to an engineering audience.
This unit will utilise problem-based learning, meaning students will learn about model conceptualization and construction in the context of relevant Environmental Engineering challenges, with real datasets to validate the models developed. It is expected that students will develop their programming skills in this unit in using a numerical programming language for model construction.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit students will advance and consolidate, beyond the level attained during OPTM5202 Community Optometry 2, the competencies defined by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand (OCANZ) in a variety of optometric and health care settings. They will further develop competencies in assessing and prescribing pharmacological interventions in optometry practice. They will advance their understanding of common conditions in optometry and the legal and ethical, professional practice and public health context of optometry work. 
The equivalent of four days per week (approximately 8 work hours per day) placement, in community settings (approximately 11 weeks, some of which fall outside of the standard university teaching periods), plus one day per week (estimated 8 hour day), across 11 teaching weeks, undertaking a structured, online program. This online program will involve engaging with specified resources, interactivity and weekly webinar participation.  In the final week of the non-standard teaching period, students are scheduled to return for one week of on-campus intensive clinical skills training and assessment.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries, societies emerged in many parts of the world which deliberately gave 'white' people power over other 'races'. This unit begins by considering the material and intellectual origins of white supremacy. Emerging doctrines of racial differentiation and evolution are viewed against the background of colonisation, plantation slavery and inter-European warfare. The remainder of the unit is devoted to case studies of racial domination in a number of societies including South Africa, the United States of America, Kenya, Zimbabwe, New Zealand and Australia.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This practicum consists of a placement scheme whereby students are hosted by a health-related agency for a full semester. Industry-based placements are arranged by matching the specific interests and desired learning outcomes of the student with the practice-based opportunities available at the respective public health organisation. Students are allocated an agency-based supervisor and a University-based supervisor. Students are expected to attend their industry placement for a minimum of 24 hours per week, plus attend the tutorials at the University. The tutorials are a combination of formal discussion of issues related to public health practice and an opportunity for students to 'debrief' and discuss their practical experiences.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The recent explosion of available data, together with advances in technology, makes data leverage critical for better business decisions. This unit focuses on three main areas of data reporting: data visualisation, data storytelling/narrative and data presentation/communication. Data visualisation involves converting raw data to an easily understood visual format that is efficient with ink and effective in portraying the messages in the data. Data storytelling or narrative is the ability to provide informative, engaging and impactful explanations of the data analysis that are relevant to the audience. Effective presentation/communication skills are fundamental for combining data visuals and data storytelling. Collectively they offer analytical output in a simple, clear and meaningful way which aids the translation of data to action. 
This foundation unit provides key competences to effectively present data and findings to a business audience. Students are able to identify appropriate data visualisations for different types of data, gain practical experience in the use of different sophisticated analytical tools and techniques to visualise and analyse data, and communicate analytical findings efficiently, effectively and in a non-technical way.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The project units are taken over two consecutive semesters for full-time enrolment or up to four consecutive semesters for part-time enrolment. Parts 1 to 4 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. In the unit, students follow one or more lines of enquiry within a supervised but independent research project. They attend a series of seminars that guide students through the process of doing publication-standard research and managing a project. Students gain experience in the identification and resolution of problems associated with their chosen discipline. They seek and define suitable projects and, in consultation with supervisors, critically analyse current knowledge, determine research goals, design and carry out research, interpret results and present the research outcomes as a written research proposal, research dissertation and oral presentation. The unit provides the research and project management skills necessary for a career as a research professional. The project management skills and experience acquired in the unit are relevant to all students wishing to practise as industry professionals.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Advanced Topics in Private Law</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit will examine and analyse selected topics in private law through the lens of an overarching private law theme. Core areas of the private law from which topics will be drawn include contract, equity and trusts, torts and equitable wrongs, legal
theory, property, remedies, unjust enrichment and cognate statutory principles and regimes.
Topics drawn from these areas will be examined by reference to overarching themes, which aim to give conceptual coherence and rigour to the unit and learning experience. The emphasis will be on providing a research-led learning
experience which integrates theoretical, doctrinal, historical and practical perspectives to enable students to develop and interrogate a holistic understanding of the private law.
The chosen themes will vary from year to year to allow teachers to explore fully and to curate investigation of contemporary
issues and developments. They are likely to include themes such as:
a) the limits and importance of autonomy in private law;
b) the attribution of responsibility and liability in private law;
c) the need for coherence in the law;
d) the boundaries of private and public law; and
e) justifying private law and the related difficulties of transitioning high-level moral principles into specific legal rules.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Service Learning Guild and Student Leaders IV</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This elective unit is only available to elected Guild and Faculty society or club office bearers with approval of the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic) on advice from the Guild President. The objective of the unit is to enable students who are incumbent office bearers to enrol in a unit for academic credit in recognition of their service contribution to the Guild and the University.  Office bearers play a vital leadership role within the student body through which they learn, develop and apply a complex mix of knowledge and skills including communication, interpersonal, decision making, prioritisation, planning and budgeting knowledge and skills, as well as goal setting and project management.  Office bearers generally benefit from community recognition and this has the potential to greatly enhance their employment and leadership opportunities in the future. This unit recognises both the service contribution of Guild and student society/club office bearers to the Guild and University and the learning experience of this role. By enrolling in this unit, students will have time freed up to enable them to make a strong contribution, minimise any possible adverse impact on their regular studies and, for some students, enable them to maintain full time enrolment. 
Includes:  Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Education Council President, Societies Council President, Public Affairs Council President, Environment Officer, International Students' Service Director, Sports Representative, Welfare Officer, Women's Officer, and Faculty Society and Club Presidents where the aims and objective of the club reflect the ethos of UWA and illustrate a contribution to the Guild, University, and the community; and where the club has over 100 members and runs at least five events of a Medium or Major classification each year, each of which includes a comprehensive event  management plan.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Critical Perspectives in Global Health</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Global health is receiving increasing recognition as a field of study in the social sciences. Governments, organisations, and research institutions around the world are working to improve and maintain the health of communities. The processes and concepts that people use in undertaking this work have crystallised over the past few decades into a set of common approaches, best practices, and dominant models for “doing global health”. Gradually, however, people are starting to question these approaches and the merits of the current global health system. In this unit, we will think critically about a range of topics related to global health, challenging our own beliefs and assumptions. We will start with a pause for reflection, thinking about definitions and language, and what is meant by “global health”. We will review the colonial history and legacies of public health, Indigenous views of health, and how globalisation, neoliberalism, and the rise of the development agenda have shaped the current system. We will discuss the state of the world's health today, the global burden of disease, current concerns, and the push for universal health care. Finally, we will explore different aspects of the global health system, exploring issues around global health governance, money and foreign aid in global health, humanitarian health, and the role of the United Nations, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores issues and approaches associated with working with particularly vulnerable and traumatised children, families and communities, and in so doing it seeks to represent the voice and perspective of service users. Attention is paid to a key aspect of the professional's role—the assessment process. The complex nature of assessment, as stage, process and relationship is explored. In addition, this unit explores the complex relationships at all levels of the child protection system, both with internal and external stakeholders. Students are asked to evaluate their own assessment competencies and areas for development. Self-care is constructed as mental health wellbeing, the organisational, professional and individual barriers and opportunities for sustaining mental health wellbeing are considered.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This is a Level 3 unit comprising a series of lecture and laboratory sessions that aim to develop in students an understanding of the key physiological functions of these systems and the scientific process via which our understanding of them arose. The unit builds on the material covering cardiovascular and respiratory function in Level 2 PHYL2001 Physiology of Human Body Systems. The unit further develops students' laboratory techniques for physiological measurement. Human experimental work covers non-invasive cardiovascular and respiratory measurements. Ethical aspects of human experimentation are covered. 
Finally the unit has a focus on data recording, analysis and presentation skills including statistical analysis, the graphical presentation of data, and communication in the form of scientific poster presentations. The unit has a major focus on visual communication of data and critical information literacy in the form of a research poster which students must pose, based on a published paper. The theme of visual communication is continued with the ongoing submission of professional quality figures and graphics using the data generated in laboratory classes. The unit also reinforces aspects of teamwork and interpersonal skills in both experimental work and communication.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is the final in a four-semester sequence that develops core theoretical, musical and perceptual skills. The unit comprises two mutually supportive components—(1) harmony, and (2) aural—in which students will develop an advanced understanding of musical grammar, both on paper and in their creative imagination. Building upon the concepts introduced in Music Language 1-3, this unit deals with more sophisticated harmonic concepts such as post-tonal harmony, and  investigates the languages and related analytical tools of post-tonal music. On completion of the four-semester Music Language program, the course aims to produce musically literate students who are able to apply the skills they have acquired in any professional situation. This unit is a core unit in the Bachelor of Music degree, and is also open to students enrolled in other majors and degree pathways who fulfil the prerequisites and who have an interest in music.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The final placement serves three purposes. It provides students with an opportunity to build on and extend the professional knowledge and skills acquired on the first placement and to apply and 'test out' subsequent theoretical and reflective learning in the University, thus allowing for the application of learning. It also provides a longer period for agency based learning, thus facilitating greater depth for learning. Finally, it offers students a contrasting practice setting, allowing them to transfer their learning across client populations, problem circumstances and organisational environments. This process facilitates the development of professional identity based on an understanding of the 'universals' of practice. The required hours of the AASW for all placements during the BSW is 1000 hours. Students need to ensure that all required hours have been completed by the end of Field Education Two. Placement hours include compulsory attendance integration days. Students are also required to attend orientation days and consolidation, which are in addition to placement hours. Students complete a Common Assessment Tool and supporting Portfolio of Evidence. Students also undertake a presentation of a critical reflection during placement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit will explore global developments in the law and governance of technology, focusing particularly on digital technologies. This leads to encounters with privacy, intellectual property, internet governance, competition, consumer protection, and the law and politics of data, automation, and artificial intelligence. Of particular interest is the question of when the law does and—perhaps more interestingly, given the political economy of technology—when the law does not intervene. Consideration will be given to domestic and international legal developments, including supranational instruments and coordinated regulatory actions. Equipped with tools from within and beyond law, students will critically engage with the political, social and legal challenges of technological change, with an emphasising on moving beyond problem-definition to exploring and identifying solutions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, pre-service teachers will further develop their knowledge and understandings of the HASS and Science curriculum, inquiry approaches and integration. The HASS and Science learning areas share a focus on the inquiry approaches and prompt children to think about the world around them, investigate and interrogate resources and investigate ways to protect people, planet, living things and resources. The geography and economics and business subjects from the HASS curriculum will be the focus of the HASS curriculum for integration. The four science understanding strands of the science curriculum will be incorporated with a focus on biological sciences and earth and space sciences. Pre-service teachers will connect theory to practice by planning a teaching and learning sequence that incorporates the inquiry approaches and curriculum integration. A further focus of the unit is on identifying opportunities to address elements of two of the general capabilities, critical and creative thinking, and personal and social capability, and cross-curriculum priorities to enhance teaching and richness of students' learning.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Translation underscores cross-cultural and cross-linguistic interactions among different peoples and societies. A significant feature of Translation Studies is that, as a rapidly growing discipline, it is highly interdisciplinary offering a focus of significant research for diverse areas of study such as linguistics, sociology, gender studies, ethnography, area studies and comparative literature and so on. This unit introduces influential approaches to the study of translation and related social and cultural phenomena from distinct disciplinary perspectives. It helps students develop an in-depth understanding of translation and related social and cultural phenomena such as globalisation, multilingualism, cross-national identity construction, and so on. Case studies are used to illustrate interdisciplinary approaches to cross-cultural contacts and interactions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Students learn how the theory of plant and animal breeding and biotechnology is applied in practice through analysing real- world cases. This unit improves communication skills and analytical skills and is taught in modules. Each module or case is taught in blocks of two weeks. Experienced professionals with special expertise in an area of genetics and genomics relevant to breeding and biotechnology deliver the lectures. Only revolutionary, successful and applicable cases in breeding and biotechnology are chosen and presented in the unit. The lecturer responsible for each module gives students a recent publication in a contemporary area of development in breeding and biotechnology and a three-hour lecture/discussion, clearly contextualising the focused area in the big picture of breeding and biotechnology. Students read the paper, participate in the lecture/discussion, and find two related papers in the same area from the literature. Based on the materials/information given and found, students write a one page commentary critically analysing the case, including the genetic foundation, process of development and successful application in the industry. Students may also comment on what they have learned, critical issues and possible future directions. Students also have a chance to give a five-minute oral presentation for each module.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Social Issues in Contemporary China</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides a comprehensive introduction to the major social, cultural and political issues that characterise contemporary China. A number of important issues are explored including the ongoing transformation of the Communist Party of China and its relationship with society; the development of a nascent civil society and public sphere; the current state of rural China; the features of urbanisation; the significance of increased mobility and migration; the impact of economic development on social life and the environment; various issues relating to ethnic identity and culture; the state of gender relations; the role of intellectual life and spaces for social critique; and the significance of globalisation for Chinese society and culture in general. 
Much of what is assumed to be known about China involves certain presuppositions and assumptions about the nature of political, social and cultural change. Students learn to distinguish the different presuppositions and assumptions which inform different approaches (e.g. media, business and state) to understanding China in the modern world. Students gain a solid base of knowledge and research skills relevant to the study of China in Asian Studies and Chinese Studies. They gain critical knowledge of the important social and political forces which are shaping contemporary China. They are trained and given the opportunity to apply various theories and modes of critical thought relating to the study of contemporary China.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is concerned with cardiovascular biomechanics which is the study of the function and the structure of the cardiovascular system using the methods of mechanics. This lies at the heart of all major cardiovascular diseases, which are responsible for about one-third of the world's deaths. The underpinning principle which is referred to several times in this unit is that the cardiovascular system adapts in order to normalise its mechanical environment. The cardiovascular system is able to do this because mechanical forces are sensed by tissues, and deviations from 'normal' results in biological changes which affect structure. 
This unit introduces students to the far-reaching field of cardiovascular biomechanics in health and disease, and provides students with new skills obtained through coursework, laboratories and assignments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is a foundation unit for students proposing to conduct research as either part of the Doctor of Medicine (MD) Scholarly Activity stream or in the future. The unit covers the principles of good scientific conduct in research and the ethical conduct of research on human participants. A brief overview of animal ethics issues is provided. The unit emphasises the importance of honesty and integrity in science and provides students with an introduction to the ethical basis of scientific requirements such as data management and documentation, dealing with conflicts of interest, open publication versus commercialisation of scientific findings, protection of intellectual property, authorship and allocation of credit, errors and mistakes in science. This unit then goes on to cover ethical issues dealing specifically with research in humans, including the four basic tenets (research merit/integrity, justice, beneficence and respect) and their historical origins, assessment of research benefits versus risk to the participants, risk minimisation, the importance and principles of informed consent, maintenance of participant confidentiality, including de-identification and storage of information and/or biological samples, and working with vulnerable populations or participants who are unable to provide informed consent.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This multidisciplinary unit takes students on a journey across space and time to examine the relationship between human beings and the environment. How do we 'see' and 'know' nature? How do we describe and experience it? Two lenses are used to examine these questions. The first is Indigenous perspectives starting from creation in the Dreaming to understandings of the environment. The second lens is the science of natural history. The unit explores the discipline's philosophy, techniques and scientific rationale. It features a short lecture series followed by interactive field work in the Albany region during the semester break.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The topics covered in this unit build on those presented in undergraduate units, and reflect cutting-edge developments in biochemistry and molecular biology, providing students with an understanding and knowledge of the discipline at an advanced level. Students develop and present a lecture on an aspect of one of the topics through independent readings, and submit an assignment related to this lecture. The lecture highlights the research that has led to our current understanding of the topic. The main academic objective of the unit is for students to gain an understanding and an appreciation of how the knowledge in a field of biochemistry and molecular biology progresses. Students' abilities in identifying and critically reviewing appropriate sources of the literature, critical thinking, data analysis, and interpretation of results are extended. They also broaden their knowledge base and gain experience in presenting material unrelated to their research project.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from INDO1403 Indonesian 3 and leads to INDO2405 Indonesian 5. It develops basic social proficiency in both formal and informal Indonesian. Using a variety of text types, students develop their ability to discuss daily life in Australia and Indonesia, focusing on Indonesian society and culture. They widen their vocabulary and their understanding of sophisticated linguistic structures. Students are introduced to the conventions of informal speech in Indonesian, using largely video material from Indonesian films and television but also youth magazines. Their writing skills are also further developed through essay writing exercises. They are expected to be able to operate relatively capably in social situations in Indonesia, demonstrating comprehension of formal and informal speech in Indonesian, providing information and expressing opinions. The unit enables students to achieve 'basic social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit deals with the principles of epidemiology with specific reference to communicable diseases including, measures of disease frequency (prevalence and incidence), measures of association (e.g. odds ratio, relative risk) and measures of disease transmission dynamics (e.g. basic reproductive number, secondary attack rate). It relates the epidemiology of infectious diseases to their modes of transmission, their pathogenesis, in addition to describing the host–parasite relationship and the importance of vectors. Methods for infectious disease control are also discussed in detail, including the roles of vaccination, antimicrobials and public health measures. Topics also include the principles of data collection and the investigation of outbreaks, measures of disease surveillance, and government regulations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the study of music in and as performance. Students will hone in on questions related to the changing circumstances surrounding musical performance, including its underlying ideology, types of musical training, locations, and relationship to musical texts. They will consider how creativity in performances and interpretation can reinforce or change the meaning of a musical work. This unit will also consider different types of performances as spectacle and commemoration; and examine the ways in which the body is engaged in performative acts. Students will be supported to develop increasingly independent research and critical reading skills in this unit.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is designed to support students to develop their employability – the set of individual attributes, understandings and skills that make individuals more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen occupations (Knight &amp; Yorke, 2003). The content is necessarily practical and is underpinned by psychological principles, models of employability and evidence-based approaches to professional development practice.
The unit involves substantial self-reflection through completion of individual questionnaires and reflection activities. As a result, the student should develop a robust understanding of their personal strengths and weaknesses relevant to the work context. Students will learn to set goals and design development action plans based on goal directed self-regulation. A focus on practical skills assists students to navigate potentially emotionally charged workplace situations- stakeholder management, stress, providing and responding to feedback and working in teams.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Issues in Women's Health Research</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The field of women's health research has expanded far beyond its roots in reproductive health and now includes the study of health across the lifespan. Women's health research covers the full spectrum of investigations from basic laboratory studies to clinical trials and involves multiple disciplines including clinical medicine, allied health, biomedical sciences, population and global health, biomedical engineering, health policy, law and economics.
Sex and gender both play a critical role in health, wellness, and disease. There are, for example, striking sex/gender differences in autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, depression and brain disorders, diabetes, infectious diseases, obesity, and substance abuse disorders. The discoveries being made through the study of women's health and sex differences are key to advancements in personalised medicine for both sexes. 
In this unit, students will apply their knowledge of research and evidence-based practice developed in IMED2208: Issues in Women's Reproductive Health. Students will explore, create and communicate like researchers as they design a research proposal and project pitch that addresses an unanswered question in women's health. Further, students will learn to provide constructive feedback through peer review.. 
This unit is the third of three core units in the Women's Health Minor.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The Roman Revolution</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit studies the period 146 BC to 44 BC: from the destruction of Corinth and Carthage down to the assassination of Julius Caesar. The unit is concerned with the final generations of the Roman Republic, during which the four centuries of political and social stability gradually evaporated in political murder, civil war, the collapse of moderation and consensus and the transformation of society, all happening against a backcloth of dramatic conquests and imperial expansion that took Roman armies as far as Britain and Iraq. The period saw the transformation of the institutions of the state and the emergence of powerful military men who dominated the Roman political scene. But it was a period which also witnessed the first real flourishing of Latin literature. 
The unit aims to impart knowledge about one of the most significant periods in ancient Mediterranean history, the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. Students are introduced to both the political and social history of the period and develop an appreciation of the importance of the relationship between the social and political mechanisms in the ancient Roman world. Students are encouraged to make independent analysis and criticism of such fundamental aspects as political alliances, personal alliances, the stratification of society, the division of wealth, etc. The unit emphasises the importance of the ancient written evidence, such as the personal correspondence and forensic speeches of M. Tullius Cicero, the personal accounts of the Gallic and Civil wars by C. Julius Caesar, and the historical monographs of Sallust, and the later accounts of Plutarch, Appian and Cassius Dio. As a result, students develop critical abilities in the process of reading and evaluating these literary sources.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The 19th Century is often described as the ‘age of empires'. This subject charts colonised peoples' responses to European and Australasian imperialism from late 18th into the 21st Century, with case studies of Indonesian responses to Dutch colonisation, Aboriginal and Dalit responses to British colonisation in Australia and India, Korean responses to Japanese colonisation, Kinh and Montagnard responses to the Chinese and French colonisation of Vietnam, and Australia's role as an imperial power in the Pacific. How, and where, have colonists' assertions of legal sovereignty affected colonised and Indigenous people? How have Indigenous and colonised people used imperial languages and legal systems, routes and rights discourses for their own ends? And how have Indigenous and colonised people represented and contested imperialism in contemporary film and fiction? Students will gain an understanding of the ways that colonised and Indigenous peoples have variously negotiated, gained knowledge about, and resisted imperial power, engage with contemporary debates about empire, and assess the diversity of violent and peaceful strategies of responding to imperialism.</ns1:description>

The lecture topics which are taught in the unit include features of virus structure; genetics and cultivation; viral taxonomy; the main viral diseases of humans; the replication cycle of the RNA and DNA viruses; genetically controlled interactions between viruses and the host; and the host immune response and the mechanisms by which certain viruses cause disease. The unit also discusses the emergence of new viral diseases, the role of insect vectors and the re-emergence of existing viral diseases together with the surveillance measures which are used to track the movement of viruses locally and globally. The control of viral diseases including the use of vaccines, antiviral drugs and other measures are also presented.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The Global MD is based around six themes of professional, leader, advocate, clinician, educator and scholar. This unit provides teaching in all of these themes within the clinical attachments and related teaching in Year 2 of the course. This includes a clinical preparation phase, completing the integrated teaching on the core body systems that was commenced in Year 1 of the Global MD and preparing students for transition to the clinical placement environment. Subsequently students undertake 6-week clinical placements throughout the year in Indigenous Health (Indian Health Service), Internal Medicine, Family &amp; Community Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Surgery, Psychiatry, internal medicine and Ambulatory Medicine – Geriatrics and Palliative Care. In this course, students will undertake their clerkships in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Surgery, Ambulatory Medicine/Geriatrics/Palliative Care and Psychiatry. Students undertake clinical care of patients under the supervision of experienced clinicians in a real clinical environment including ward rounds, operating theatre experience, outpatient clinics, community practices and other clinical encounters. Students engage in small group learning sessions to discuss evidence-based practice in related clinical disciplines in hospital and community health contexts. Students are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes gained in context within these clinical rotations.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Autocracy and Democracy in Asia</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>With democracy on the slide globally, it is more pressing than ever to understand autocratic regimes not as anomalies but as sophisticated and sustainable systems in their own right. How do they work, how do they endure, how are they legitimated, and why do some ultimately collapse?  With a focus on East and Southeast Asia, this unit explores not only varieties of authoritarianism but also the global and local factors which lead to democracy in some countries and authoritarianism or even dictatorship in others. Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, it investigates political forms of rule, ideologies, leaders and leadership, state-society relations, and resistance movements. Students will learn to analyze similarities and differences between various regimes, explain the rise and fall of autocratic governments, and connect wider global trends to local manifestations in Asia, gaining an understanding of the persistence of authoritarianism in our own times.  
The academic objectives of the unit are to (1) develop knowledge and understanding of key theories of political change; (2) evaluate theoretical debates about the causes, processes and prospects of autocracy and democracy in the Asian context; (3) develop an appreciation of the variety of political cultures in the Asian region; (4) develop knowledge of specific states and societies experiencing political transitions; (5) improve interpersonal and communication skills; and (6) develop the ability to conduct independent research utilising a variety of sources.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In  this  unit,  students  are  introduced  to  a  range  of  marketing  topics,  in  preparation  for  the  specific marketing  major  units  in  following  years.  Marketing  is  built  on  the  premise  that  organisational, business,  and  even  personal  success  comes  through  understanding  the  needs  and  perspectives  of others,  and  through  communicating  with  others  based  on  this  understanding.  Marketing  is  the function  that  links  all  organisations  to  their  external  environments.  Marketing  is  responsible  for gathering and analysing data from many sources, such as social media. Then, based on this research, it is responsible for developing products and services for a range of customers, and promoting these offerings in many ways, such as through search engines.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Through the exploration of six key thematic areas, this unit introduces students to the drivers and consequences of the most significant environmental challenges of our time, in addition to critically assessing the basis for potential solutions. Essential concepts in environmental physics, chemistry and biology are introduced throughout each module to develop essential knowledge and skills within the broader context of environmental science. This material forms the basis of more focused content delivered in Levels 2 and 3 of the Environmental Science and Geographical Science majors. 
The unit content is delivered through modules related to: climate change and carbon pollution; catchment development and water resource management; biodiversity loss and conservation; land degradation; coastal systems; and cities. Through these lenses, the unit looks to explain lessons from the past using both local and global examples to ensure students establish the connection between environmental processes and the manifestation of environmental degradation and recovery.  Tutorial sessions are included to complement key lectures to encourage students to participate in activities related to problem identification and conceptualisation, and critical assessment of diverse information sources. In addition, each module has a component related to data analysis and the development of written and oral communication skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit integrates speaking, reading and writing, aural comprehension, grammar and syntax with materials drawn from German literary, social and cultural history. Students are introduced to central issues in German literature and society from the Baroque period to the Romantic periods through the study and discussion of selected texts in lectures and seminar-style classes. Students develop an appreciation for the intricacies of the German language used in older texts. The cultural studies seminar focuses on reading, understanding and discussion of German history, literature and culture. The language class focuses on academic reading and essay writing skills as well as advanced communication skills in German. The unit leads to GRMN2408 German Studies 8 where the focus is on the period from Romanticism to Modernity.
Students gain an increased level of competency in all four macro skills—listening to, speaking, reading and writing German corresponding to proficiency Levels B2/C1 and upwards of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen).
Students develop an increased awareness of intercultural understanding and of language learning, as well as research skills and communication strategies and increased awareness of how languages work in general.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit enhances students' basic social proficiency in Indonesian at intermediate level, augmenting INDO2403 Indonesian 3 with the emphasis on more sophisticated spoken and written Indonesian. It gives students practical background in both Indonesian language and culture. Students consolidate what they learned in INDO1401 Indonesian 1 and INDO1402 Indonesian 2, especially the grammar, and expand their vocabulary. In addition they 'take a tour' through parts of Indonesia, so that when they go to Indonesia, they know how to behave, how to survive and how to explore its society, culture and environment. The unit aims to equip students with the listening and speaking skills to travel in Indonesia, to enable them to read simple information about places and life in Indonesia and to describe places and travel experiences in prose and conversations. 
The unit is for students who have completed INDO1402 Indonesian 2 or INDO1102 Indonesian Beginners II or equivalent, and is available only to Level 2 students who have studied Indonesian for one year at university level. It is run parallel to INDO2403 Indonesian 3 and aims to reinforce and solidify knowledge of grammar, syntax and vocabulary taught in Level 1, to significantly expand vocabulary and oral and written fluency, and to extend student capacity in all four language skills (speaking, listening, writing and reading) of contemporary Indonesian. It broadens Indonesian language and cultural knowledge. A larger, intangible objective is to nurture an interest in Indonesian culture and society.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers biostatistical methods commonly used in epidemiological and clinical research. It focuses on modern regression methods for means of quantitative variables, proportions (prevalences or risks) for binary variables, incidence rates for event counts, and survival curves for time-to-event variables. It also includes a few classical methods that are still in common use. Topics include analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression, 2 x K frequency tables, logistic regression, Poisson regression, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. The application of these methods to the analysis of data from cross sectional, case control, cohort and clinical studies is discussed and critical appraisal of published literature is included. Computing using SAS is an integral part of the unit.
Students who master the methods covered in this unit should be able to conduct many of their own analyses of health/medical research data.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Suburban Cultures</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>As the world becomes increasingly urbanised and the hinterland more remote from urban centres, the threat to wilderness is intensifying. Sprawling suburban areas are providing challenges for planners, developers, ecologists and architects as well as for the communities who reside there. Solutions for the curtailment of metropolitan spread point frequently to the densifying of urban centres and infilling of inner suburban zones. How might architects respond to the various issues and imperatives associated with the often conflicting desires for and impacts of suburban living? What are the social, cultural, economic, spatial and material qualities of suburban landscapes that appeal to and attract large sections of the population? Are they sustainable? Should they be preserved? What future development trajectories or scenarios might we imagine and implement? 
As a way of addressing these complex questions confronting all developed and developing countries, this unit explores the evolution over the last two centuries of suburban cultures and landscapes around the globe. It studies the factors that gave rise to suburban ideals, patterns, practices and lifestyles as they have either changed or persisted over time. Australia's suburban culture and development provide a main focus. Themes of utopianism and pastoralism, speculation and mass production, sustainability and resilience, among others, are studied as a means of understanding the characteristics, opportunities and limitations of the liminal in-between realm of the suburb. Theorists, critics, architects and artists from Australia and overseas provide the intellectual armature for enquiry and evaluation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Students examine theories and key aspects of language and social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood to understand the interdependence of developmental domains and how they influence learning. Students learn how to apply theories to support meaningful, communicative and educative interaction in a range of early childhood settings. These include individual and collaborative play; peer teaching and learning; teacher–learner interaction; intentional teaching, sustained shared conversations and questioning strategies; self regulation, behaviour management and the building of positive self-esteem. Students explore various early childhood pedagogies such as social, relational and play based pedagogies. The unit has a strong emphasis on developing students' skills and strategies for supporting children's oral language development along with other communicative and social competencies. Students engage with the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) to guide practice and support planning and implementation of quality teaching and learning which recognises the role of partnerships with parents and caregivers.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Genes are the backbone of life, and plant improvement is based on the knowledge of applied genetics and supported by modern biotechnologies. This unit allows students to extend their knowledge and interest in genetics in the applied field of plant improvement and biotechnology. Whether the focus of study is in genetic conservation in native plants or genetic improvement in domesticated plants and animals, the principles are the same. The unit provides a very sound foundation in evolutionary genetics theory and principles that are applicable to any genetic system. Students also study biotechnologies that support modern breeding programs, and at the conclusion of the unit, are able to make sound judgements on the value of 'traditional' plant breeding, genetic engineering or molecular genetic markers in crop improvement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the origin, design, implementation, and measurements of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from a range of scientific, practical, and policy perspectives. It provides students with the tools to contextualise the SDGs from global and local contexts and to understand the interconnectedness between the goals, targets, and indicators. Students will analyse the discourses, challenges, and solutions of sustainable development, from both social and environmental viewpoints and through creative monitoring and evaluation tools. Students will learn how to use the growing online resources on the SDGs, such as the SDG Atlas, the SDG Index and Dashboard, and the SDG Mapping Tool, to critically reflect on their own and other people's lives in the context of the SDGs. Students will also hone and apply their sustainability literacy to examine opportunities and blind spots of the SDG concept through concrete community examples in both the Global South and the Global North. The unit will foster cross-cutting skills and core competencies needed to address the SDGs, including critical thinking, self-awareness, integrated problem-solving, design thinking, social responsibility, and anticipatory, normative, strategic and collaboration competencies.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit explores the work of a number of influential continental philosophers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, especially those philosophers belonging to the phenomenological tradition. Thinkers discussed may include Kant, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Gadamer and Derrida. Much continental philosophy can be read as an attempt to find a way between traditional philosophical dichotomies such as subject/object, internal/external, realism/anti-realism. As a result, each of these philosophers has important things to say about truth, meaning, the self, knowledge and our relation to others. Given the profound influence of these philosophers on Western thought, their work is of central importance to all students of the humanities and social sciences.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Dispute Resolution</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Despite the fact that only a very small percentage of cases proceed to trial, legal education has traditionally emphasised adversarial dispute resolution processes. Yet there are numerous ways for people to resolve their disputes without recourse to lawyers and courts, and now the legal fraternity is embracing these deeper ways of dealing with conflict. This unit explores several methods of dispute resolution as a comparison to litigation and aims to seek a balance between the uses of the different forms. It investigates the various dispute resolution processes including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and mixed processes, to gain familiarity with the processes, rudimentary skills in using them and some experience in choosing the most appropriate process to use to resolve a particular dispute.
Students are able to (1) analyse the nature and cause of disputes; (2) understand the various forms of dispute resolution including litigation and how they work in practice; (3) advise clients on the appropriate use of different dispute resolution methods; (4) understand how to engage in constructive negotiation, mediation and arbitration; and (5) critically evaluate and research the various issues that arise in ADR practice.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Social Media and the Law</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>More than a billion people, businesses, governments and other entities currently use social media. Judicial officers, courts, lawyers and other individuals in the legal system also use social media. However, the law generally struggles to keep up with making changes that are necessary or beneficial due to social media's existence. For example, most Australian courts only developed policies/Australian governments only passed legislation concerning whether journalists can use social media in courtrooms about seven years after social media was created and years after millions of Australians started to use it. This unit gives students an understanding of many of the key legal and ethical issues that social media raises for the law.
In this unit, students learn about some of the areas in which social media plays a significant role in the law. In the first eight lectures students learn about how social media impacts upon specific stakeholders in the legal system. For the next four lectures students learn about how social media impacts upon specific areas of law.
Four main themes of this unit are: (a) social media poses many challenges and benefits for the legal system and there are many more yet to come; (b) Australian law is slow to adapt to social media; (c) in some instances social media creates new situations that the legal system has yet to experience before and in some instances social media may simply be a contemporary take on a long-standing issue; it can be contentious which situation is which; and (d) it can be challenging to decide whether new ethical guidelines are necessary that apply to social media or whether existing ethical guidelines are sufficient to apply to social media (e.g. ethical guidelines for the judiciary and for lawyers).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers the application of psychological theory and methods for the purpose of ensuring that the particular individuals hired by an organisation are likely to be successful employees. Basic concepts used to assess the quality of selection instruments are covered (e.g. validity, reliability, adverse impact, test bias and utility). In addition, the contemporary scientific evidence about various approaches to personnel selection (e.g. cognitive ability tests, employment interviews, personality questionnaires, assessment centres, etc.) are covered. Unit content is addressed from the perspective of scholarly research as well as applied practice. Throughout the semester, students are continuously exposed to empirical research and scholarly investigation as it applies to selection and assessment, as well as the practicalities of developing and running a selection process. The unit is designed to further students' knowledge of selection and assessment at an advanced level and to give practical exposure to running selection and assessment processes.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This service learning unit provides students with the opportunity to participate in a research internship program through the West Australian Parliament. The program is a cooperative arrangement between the Western Australian Parliament and the State universities through which students undertake the research of topics nominated by Members of Parliament. Students will undertake projects that are of benefit to West Australia and that build on their knowledge and skills from a wide range of disciplines. The program is restricted to excellent students, from third year and who may be majoring in any discipline. Excellent UWA students are put forward to the WA Parliament using a selection process that may include consideration of a written expression of interest, interview, academic standing, topic selection, and consideration of the programme guidelines.  
 
Students selected by the WA Parliamentary Research Programme  will participate by assuming the role of a research assistant under the guidance of a Member of Parliament. As this is a research-focused project, nominated students must have the required skills, academic standing and self-motivation to successfully complete the research program. Further guidance and support throughout the program is provided through the academic supervisor and through staff in the Parliamentary Education Office. Final projects are lodged with the West Australian Parliamentary Library.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is the third in a four-semester sequence that develops core theoretical, musical and perceptual skills. The unit comprises two mutually supportive components—(1) harmony, and (2) aural—in which students will develop an advanced understanding of musical grammar, both on paper and in their creative imagination. Building upon the concepts introduced in Music Language 1 and 2, this unit deals with more sophisticated harmonic concepts and chromaticism. On completion of the four-semester Music Language program, the course aims to produce musically literate students who are able to apply the skills they have acquired in any professional situation. This unit is a core unit in the Bachelor of Music degree, and is also open to students enrolled in other majors and degree pathways who fulfil the prerequisites and who have an interest in music.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The operation of the economic market has profound effects - good and bad - for individuals in every society, around the world. The aim of this unit is to consider these effects from three distinct disciplinary perspectives - philosophy, politics, and economics. Topics covered may include markets in sex and drugs, the relationship between the market and democracy, sweatshops, inequality, taxation, and justice in the workplace. We shall see how adopting an interdisciplinary, integrated perspective on these issues can help us understand them in a more sophisticated way.
Note: this is an issues-based unit that is designed to provide students with an interdisciplinary introduction to the topics discussed, and to provide a general introduction to the methods of philosophy, economics, and political science. Students seeking a more rigorous introduction to these areas should consider each discipline's respective first-year offerings (e.g. POLS1101, ECONS1101, PHIL1001).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Pre-service teachers will be introduced to the nature of science and science as a way of understanding the world around us based on evidence. Preservice teachers will become familiar with the structure and content of the F-6 science curriculum. They will learn about (1) science understanding (biological, chemical, physical and earth and space sciences), (2) science inquiry skills and (3) science as a human endeavour. Pre-service teachers will come to understand how children learn about abstract scientific concepts and the importance of considering prior knowledge. Emphasis will be placed on effective and inclusive teaching strategies such as inquiry-based teaching, active learning, student-centred teaching, practical work and cooperative group work.

    <ns1:description>This unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 to 4 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. In this unit students undertake the honours dissertation, which comprises supervised research conducted by the individual student. The student's understanding of the topic of the dissertation is developed through an individually guided program of library research, reading and attendance at occasional research seminars within the School. Students research the relevant literature, design the research project, write the research proposal, give an oral presentation of the research proposal, and submit an application for ethical approval of the dissertation. Students complete their research and submit their written theses. The thesis includes a literature review, descriptions of the methods and results, and a discussion. As part of the unit students also make an oral presentation to academic staff of their research and findings during the second semester.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is the fifth of a vertically-integrated series of design units forming the “Design Spine” of the Environmental Engineering program. 
This unit requires students to implement a design solution to a real world, local environmental engineering problem.  Working as a single class team, students implement a solution drawn from their own tender proposals formed in the preceding unit ENVE5551. Students are self-guided with the support of the instructor.  They are given the freedom to determine how to organise their workforce, how to implement their tasks, and how to time and stage their project.  Throughout the semester the instructor critically reviews progress, suggests issues for the class to consider addressing, related to technical and project management issues, and assists the class in accessing resources, resolving problems, and decision-making.  At the end of the semester, the students present their solutions to their client and a public audience consisting of relevant stakeholders and participants from UWA. Where possible the class will be designed so that a tangible product can be handed over from the class to the client, representing the capstone design experience for the students.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Theory II Part 2</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the second-year theory unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and  and  part 2  DENT 6840 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the academic year . The unit allows the more advanced application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning.
Teaching Methods: Prescribed readings, seminars, tutorials, discussions, and student
presentations.
Assessment: The assessment in these two semester theory units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are: active participation in seminars and presentations from other registrars and
staff and presentations of assignments (periodontal/implant topics; case presentations and
journal clubs). The assignments (written essay; presentation; journal club and case presentation) should demonstrate original, individual input from the student with critical thinking.
Additional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semester are:
DOPS (Direct observation of procedural skills) , CbD (case based discussion) and Mini-CEX (Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise) forms. Although these are mainly used in a clinical setting
they can contribute to assess the Registrar and give immediate feedback on both clinical and theoretical aspects
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with two to three internal examiners will be carried out as
below:
A three hour written exam (40%)
One hour oral exam (40%)
critical appraisal of a scientific article (20%)</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>A large part of the work done by lawyers in practice is determining the meaning and application of words in statutes and contracts. The law of interpretation is the law that deals with the legal principles, aids and method of how to engage in that interpretation. This unit will mainly deal with the law of statutory interpretation, but will also cover key aspects of the law relating to the interpretation of contracts (which is distinct from the law on the formation and enforcement of contracts studied in LAWS4103 Contract). The unit will focus on the primary legislative and common law principles that govern the reading and understanding of the text in its context, and having regard to the instrument's purpose, in order to infer the ‘intention' of the maker. For statutes, other topics covered include legislative drafting, the relationship between statutes and between statutes and the common law, use of extrinsic materials, and delegated legislation. For contracts, other topics covered include use of surrounding circumstances and post-contractual conduct, and interpretation of particular classes of contract (eg: commercial contracts, State Agreements in the resources sector). The unit will highlight the similarities and the differences in the function of interpretation for statutes (public instruments) and contracts (private instruments), and in the approaches adopted by the legislature and the courts to the interpretation of each instrument.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Physiology - How Does the Human Body Work?</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the main physiological systems in the human body. There is an emphasis on the physiological mechanisms utilised by the cells, tissues and organs of these systems to maintain the internal environment and allow the human body to function.
The unit starts with an examination of how the brain coordinates the overall activity of body tissues, organs and systems, using specialised nerve and hormonal signalling pathways. Students are then provided with an in-depth look at how the cardiovascular system (heart and the circulation) works to provide the tissues with nutrients and oxygen as well as the removal waste material. This is followed by an examination of how the respiratory system (lungs and associated tissues), functions to ensure adequate uptake of oxygen and removal of  carbon dioxide by the body. Students will then be introduced to the renal system (kidneys and associated tissues) and shown how this system regulates the fluid and salt composition of the body and helps rid the body of waste materials and toxins such as pesticides.  The reproductive system will also be covered, with a focus on the hormonal control mechanisms governing spermatogenesis (sperm production) and the ovarian cycle (preparation of the ova). Finally, students will examine the gastrointestinal system (stomach, intestines and associate structures) and learn how this system undertakes the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
In addition to examining the normal functions of the human body, this unit also provides many  examples outlining how disease can severely disrupt the function of the physiological systems described above. 
Four practical classes are provided in this unit. These classes are designed to reinforce the theoretical content presented in the physiological control, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal system components of the course. The practical component will also  provide students with important insights into experimental design, as well and experience and skills in making clinically relevant physiological measurements such as blood pressure (heart disease), the electrocardiograph (ECG) (heart disease), the ability of the lungs to inhale and forcibly exhale air (asthma), and urine volume, sodium concentration, and specific gravity, which provide information about bodily salt and water balance.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to contemporary spoken and written Japanese. The main objective of the unit is for students to develop the basics of everyday communication and communication skills in Japanese by the end of the semester. The unit makes use of all four basic language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Students are able to satisfy some basic aural and oral communication needs using the most common polite register, in specific situations such as introduction of self and others, and describing locations and things; initiate and sustain simple conversations in brief sentences spoken slowly; understand simple texts; and write simple original sentences. Learning takes place with reference to everyday student life in Japan and Australia. Successful completion of this unit brings students to the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (ISLPR) Level 1-.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Pre-service teachers will develop their scientific literacy and science inquiry skills as they are introduced to the wonder of science. Pre-service teachers will become familiar with the structure and content of the science curriculum for the first three years of formal schooling. They will learn about (1) science understanding (biological, chemical, physical and earth and space sciences), (2) science inquiry skills and (3) science as a human endeavour. Pre-service teachers will come to understand how young children learn and develop positive attributes about science (e.g., curiosity, confidence and
enthusiasm) through play, exploration and investigation both in formal and informal contexts. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to use effective and inclusive teaching strategies such as play-based learning, hands-on exploration, guided investigations, and cooperative group work. A variety of ways of assessing young children's science learning and communication skills will be practiced. Contemporary early years science resources that integrate STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in real life contexts will be examined.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Coastal Hazards and Adaptation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Australia, as many other countries, is a coastal focused nation with approximately 80% of the population living within 50 km of the coast. The coast also plays a key role in Australia's economy by providing a conduit for a range of direct economic activity as well as being a major draw for domestic and international tourism. The pressures placed on the coast resulting from the coastal population density and development result in coastal areas being at high risk for a number of hazards, including inundation, erosion, and water quality deterioration, all of which will be exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. In this unit students will gain an understanding of the processes that result in a range of coastal hazards, with an emphasis on coastal change and water quality.  The unit is spread across three central themes; coastal change, coastal and estuarine water quality, and planning and regulatory framework to manage and adapt to coastal hazards. A key component of the unit will be examining case studies where a range of remediation and adaptation strategies have been applied to address coastal change and poor water quality. Through these case studies students will learn how to assess costal vulnerability including an understanding of the data required to make such an assessment and the various strategies to minimize it through intervention and/or adaptation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>What did the term 'woman' mean in the Middle Ages and early modern period? How were the characteristics of 'femininity' established? How did girls become women? In particular, how did the social norms applying to 'female' and 'male' affect the lives of individuals? This unit investigates how gender was established and acted out in the Middle Ages and early modern period. In particular, it analyses the writings of women themselves, to see how they thought about gender structures, how they influenced the discourses about gender in their own time, and how their own lives impacted on, and were affected by, their historical context. The time span is a long one—700 years of complex cultural interactions between 1100 and 1800 AD. It explores a wide range of female experiences in the medieval and early modern period: women and religion; women, marriage and the household; women in the wider community and finally, women and politics. Students also discover how greatly historians' interpretations of gender relations have changed in recent decades and debate the effects of historical change on the lives of women and men in the past.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The explosion in power of computers over recent times is changing the face of statistical science. Once upon a time, intuitively attractive statistical procedures had to be consigned to the waste bin if they led to unfathomable mathematical complications, or required masses of intricate calculations for their practical implementation. Now such difficulties can often be circumvented by using computer simulation and number crunching. This has led to the development and widespread use of many new statistical tools including the bootstrap, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and non-parametric kernel smoothing methods. Computer intensive statistical methods are not only in general use by statisticians, but are also applied by quantitative researchers in the life sciences, medicine and biological science, social sciences and business.
This unit gives a broad coverage of computer intensive methods with numerous applied examples, together with the underlying general concepts and basic theory. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of these methods in real statistical applications. Data sets are analysed using the statistical package R. Topics are selected from the following: simulation and Monte Carlo, bootstrap methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and Bayesian inference, non-parametric kernel smoothing methods, and statistical/machine learning.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers the content of PHYS3002, but with the addition of general relativity. The general theory of relativity is a major building block of modern physics, which lies at the heart of exciting astrophysical and cosmological discoveries made in the past decade. This addition provides an introduction to general relativity as a theory of gravity, which associates the gravitational attraction with the changing geometry of space-time instead of the traditional view of an invisible force.  Students will explore the concepts and theories relating to the Big Bang, Black Holes and Gravitational Waves.  
In this unit, students will learn about (1) electrodynamics — conservation laws, electromagnetic waves, potentials and fields, radiation; and (2) special relativity — special theory of relativity, relativistic mechanics, relativistic electrodynamics, (3) introduction to general relativity —  the equivalence principle,  curved spacetime coordinates, spacetime metric, Schwarzschild geometry and the geodesic equation. The content is explored with reference to a range of applications and physical contexts, and developed and applied through a laboratory experiment. Skills in problem identification, mathematical exploration and solution are fostered through practice problem sets, workshop activities and a laboratory experiment.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Theory &amp; Practice of Risk Regulation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit covers major theories and practices of regulation such as principles-based and rules-based regulation, statutory regulation, market-based regulation and self-regulatory schemes. It explores the realm of public, private and hybrid regulatory initiatives, where public and private entities collaborate or compete. Against this general theoretical background, the unit focuses on the regulation of risks. Whether one is discussing climate change, the rise of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the role of expertise in government, the safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods, emerging diseases and pandemics, or the prospect of financial crises, a narrative of risk permeates public discourse. Attitudes towards risk can vary considerably, entailing very different uses of legal and regulatory instruments. This unit provides a comprehensive coverage of theoretical backgrounds and practical examples of regulatory frameworks for the prevention, assessment, management of, and reaction to, a broad range of risks. As it is in the nature of risks to transcend borders, there is a strong focus on the transnational dimension of their regulation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Good mental wellbeing is a fundamental attribute in today's hectic world for individuals, their families and the community as a whole. Conversely, mental illness is a major cause of disability, diminished quality of life and reduced productivity in Australia. This unit provides students with a detailed understanding of mental health and wellbeing, explores challenges to mental wellbeing at different stages of life, and educates and equips students with strategies to enhance, practice and promote positive lifelong mental wellbeing for themselves and others. 
The unit introduces students to a range of interrelated topics that will enable a thorough exploration of what it means to be mentally healthy and how this can be maintained over a lifetime. There is an emphasis on positive psychology which includes teaching and discussion of topics such as positive emotion; engagement; developing positive relationships; sleep; creativity; happiness; and the practice of mindfulness. The unit utilises an interactive and engaging format that will provide students with knowledge and skills that are relevant to maintaining good mental wellbeing throughout the lifespan.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit presents an introduction to soil mechanics for civil engineering foundation designs and mining engineering. The topics range from the basic 
soil classifications for engineering purpose, to concepts of effective stress; soil compression and consolidation; seepage; and the strength of soils. The underlying framework is that of critical state soil mechanics which links the strength and stiffness of soil to the density and effective stress level. 
In-class practice sessions are an essential component of the teaching of the unit to ensure students gain supervised experience in the application of effective stress and critical state principles. Students gain hands-on experience in laboratory experiments and report on soil engineering properties based on the laboratory experiments. The laboratory experiments are designed to supplement understanding gained at lectures on the soil classification and strength of soils.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Dissertation units are typically taken over two successive semesters and parts 1 to 4 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the dissertation. Students can commence part 1  in either semester 1 or semester 2. Parts 1 to 4 of the Research Dissertation are the application and iterative refinement of the BIOL5551 Masters in Biological Sciences Research Project Development unit. They encompass the 'active' component of the research project—the laboratory work, interviews, measurement, field work, analysis of data gathered from the experimental phase of the research project and development of an interpretative discussion of the findings. The units are conducted under the guidance of the supervisor and with feedback provided in the final seminar presented in the unit BIOL5556 Masters in Biological Sciences Research Presentation Skills. The units culminate in the submission of the completed research paper for evaluation.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Computer Vision</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Computer vision is the science of automatically computing information and making decisions from an observed image, image set or an image sequence. It combines concepts from 'image processing' (in the spatial and frequency domains) and 'pattern recognition'. Computer vision has a wide number of potential applications, including satellite imaging, control and measurement, industrial inspection, surveillance (e.g. face recognition) and medical applications. This unit covers topics such as binary image analysis, greyscale image manipulation, linear and nonlinear filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, image segmentation and recognition. It also covers camera calibration and projective geometry and how three-dimensional information can be reconstructed from single images, stereo pairs of images and motion sequences. In the future, it is anticipated that computer vision systems will become prevailing, and that vision technology will be more applied across a broad range of business and consumer products. This will result in a strong industry demand for computer vision engineers—for people who understand vision technology and know how to apply it in real-world problems.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Clinical Practice II Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the second-year clinical practice unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease and implant treatment. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning. The unit comprises two distinct but inseparable parts: periodontology—the study of the periodontal tissues and their diseases; and periodontics—the application of periodontology to the clinical treatment and management of periodontal conditions and the interrelation with other clinical disciplines.
Students will be supervised during clinical sessions by specialist Periodontists. On average, five half-day sessions per week are devoted to the Periodontics and Implant   Clinics.  Students are required to maintain a logbook, summarising all patients treated during their training, which is evaluated throughout the course.
Teaching Methods: Clinical management of patients whilst being supervised by specialist
Periodontists, pre-clinical laboratory work, workshops, &amp; student presentations of case reports.
Assessment: Students are continuously assessed by their supervisors during clinical practice
sessions. 
Participation in seminars and the presentation of case reports will also be assessed.
The formal assessment in these two semester clinical practice units consists of a combination of
formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are:Participation in the clinical sessions as primary operatorSatisfactory completion of periodontal cases documented in form of a clinical logbookAdditional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semesterare DOPS, CbD and Mini-CEX forms. 
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with internal and external examiners ) will be carried out as below:
clinical assessment (ongoing) (50%)
case presentation (30%)
clinical logbook (20%)</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit will focus on the spectrum of animal diversity, from single celled organisms through to vertebrates.  This diversity will be categorised systematically into the 35 phyla, and classes of the major phyla, the organisation of which reflects their evolutionary history. The evolution of animals will be illustrated using the classic study of the change in body structure (‘bauplans'), from simple to complex tissues, organs, segmentation, limbs and other body parts.  This will be compared with evolution discerned by modern molecular sequence methods, and how the differences between these methods can be understood.  Factors influencing the evolution of animal diversity will be explored, within and between phyla, in the context of coincidental changes in climate, geology, and ecology throughout evolutionary history.  Theoretical concepts developed during lectures will be explored in laboratory classes. Representative species from major phyla and classes will be examined to understand body structure, and to demonstrate the characters used to categorise animals into phyla and classes.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides a framework for understanding the challenges and barriers that are facing healthcare organisations.  
The unit provides an overview of how healthcare institutions are organised and managed including primary care centres, acute care hospitals and post-acute care facilities, public payers and insurers, medical devices firms, and biotech and pharmaceutical firms. Emerging trends in healthcare including digitisations, delivery system, telemedicine, smart-phone app-based diagnosis and monitoring and globalisation of healthcare delivery are changing the competitive landscape.  
The strategic management of healthcare organisation unit is an advanced subject within the MBA program, offered to students who wish to pursue their career in the healthcare industry or to enhance the strategic skills for students who are already involved in the healthcare industry. The learnings in this unit are focused primarily on healthcare organisations, and we believe these learnings are also applicable to not-for-profit organisations and will help students who would like to build their career in the non-profit organisational setting.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The development and advancement of science relies heavily on effective written and spoken communication. Strong communication skills allow scientists to acquire new information, convey research results, mount convincing arguments, make decisive and evidence-based decisions, form effective and worthwhile collaborations, and become leaders who can influence the perception of science in their discipline and in wider society. 
This unit is built around a series of modules to help students develop the skills needed to communicate effectively. Students will learn to find, examine and critically analyse information relating to a scientific topic. They learn different ways to discuss and present scientific ideas, write their own scientific paper or report, and give oral presentations. 
Modules include guidance on effective use of library and information services, the presentation of research data, ethical considerations in research conduct and publication, and exploring the various conduits for disseminating research findings. This unit is of interest to postgraduate coursework students, who will become more employable through the acquisition of research ethics and communication skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is taken over two successive semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit focuses on the assessment and management of complex clients and related issues with first semester focusing on adults and second semester on paediatric clients. Once a hearing loss is confirmed (PHYL5502/PHYL5512 Basic Clinical Audiology Part 1/Part 2), the next step is to determine the site of lesion, possible treatments and a management plan. The unit prepares the audiologist with specialised audiometric techniques and management strategies. It also enables the audiologist to work as part of a management team in neonatal, paediatric and educational settings, and within the deaf community. Also emphasised is tinnitus management, and tinnitus assessment and treatment. Each component of assessment must be passed in order to pass the unit.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Large data sets, modelling, and meta-analysis are essential components of modern science. Scientists of all types (e.g., biologists, ecologists, conservation scientists, environmental scientists and marine scientists) now generate and/or use large amounts of observational or derived data, and the ability to find, explore, check, clean, gap-fill, cross-link, combine, harmonise, analyse and interpret such datasets is more and more important in developing new knowledge and science. Meta-analysis allows scientists to synthesise the data obtained from systematic literature reviews, or other collections of data from different studies. Dynamic models help scientists understand, predict and manage biological systems, by simulating how the most important components of the system interact to affect the overall behaviour of the system. 
In this unit, students will be introduced to the theory and practice of dynamic modelling, big data science, and meta-analysis, via a series of discussion workshops and hands-on lab sessions. There is a focus on developing highly-valued skills and experience in data handling, data exploration, modelling and meta-analysis, as well as higher-level general understanding of the challenges, considerations and opportunities of these increasingly important scientific approaches.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The interactions between Earth surface processes, including physical, chemical and biological drivers, have led to the development and evolution of individual landforms and regional scale landscapes over a range of temporal and spatial scales. These geomorphic features record both current landforms and the geological record of past landscapes and provide an opportunity to investigate the geological records of Earth surface processes in relation to climatic and environmental change, including the interpretation and use such records to reconstruct landforms, landscapes and landscape evolution in their tectonic and climatic context. The unit will focus on how surface environments evolved over the last two to three million years, and critically, how they may change in the future. We will also look at the influences and core drivers of landscape evolution such as climate, tectonics, seismic and volcanic activity, vegetation and ecology, ice sheets and glaciers; and oceans and sea level.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Comparative law has long played an important role in statutory law reform but is also gaining increasing acceptance in the decision making process of appellate courts. The comparative study of foreign law can contribute to a deeper understanding of our own legal system and to the development of new solutions for legal issues. This unit introduces students to the comparative law method and to the basic structures and principles of selected major legal systems, with reference to various areas of law.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The History of Sport: Belonging and Identity, Protest and Celebrity</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Sport provides a sense of belonging, gives meaning to people's lives, and helps to define how we see ourselves and others. It has shaped the world we live in - being widely used as a forum for establishing and challenging social, racial and gendered power structures. It's also one of the world's most lucrative businesses - generating billions of dollars in advertising revenue and corporate sponsorship and through cutting-edge marketing. This unit examines the changing relationship between sport, society and commerce in a global context between 1850 and 2020. It looks at how sport contributes to understandings of, and is shaped by, issues such as identity, protest, race, gender, celebrity, ethics, marketing, commerce and the media. Specific case studies include: the origins and development of modern sport in Victorian Britain and its Empire; sport and Australian national identity; gender, sexism and sport; the business of sport; sporting brands and celebrities; drugs and racism in sport; and sport as a vehicle for social protest and change. Students will come away with an understanding of different analytical frameworks used in the history of sport; an understanding of the historical context within which to appreciate the changing nature and evolution of sport; and an understanding of how the history of sport can inform pressing issues in society, business and sports science today. The unit has been designed to give it a broad inter-disciplinary appeal. No prior study of history is required.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>What is Australia? This unit critically interrogates the national framework for Australian history, aiming to explore the continent's long-term history in regional and global context, and its culturally diverse identities. Applying a historical focus to the many ways the continent has been understood, we adopt a case study approach, starting with the concept of ‘Deep Time', our geological and biological history, the arrival of humans, Asian polities and trade, cosmopolitan networks and European ‘discovery' from the 17th century onwards, British imperialism, colonisation and cultural exchange, and key themes in the Australian imaginary over the 19th century such as multicultural economies, gender and empire, and citizenship and rights at Federation in 1901. Through documentary, material and visual sources, the unit aims to develop an informed and critically engaged citizenship, and to give students skills in the historical and cultural analysis of Australia in its global relationships.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing technologies have advanced rapidly in recent decades, and now provide essential tools for examining both physical and built environments. As core business in a wide range of private, public, government and non-government organisations, increased accessibility to spatial information and spatial analytic techniques has dramatically increased employment opportunities for skilled individuals. This unit moves beyond the fundamentals of GIS to explore in greater depth and breadth, concepts first introduced in GEOG2201 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems but with a heavy emphasis on Remote Sensing (the science of obtaining information about objects from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites). The unit focuses on providing students with a broad overview of Remote Sensing fundamentals, as well as an in-depth examination of how remote sensing techniques can support geospatial data acquisition, handling and analyses – with a particular interest in GIS-Remote Sensing integration. To this end, the unit provides theoretical knowledge and advanced skills needed to use GIS and Remote Sensing techniques to address pressing social and environmental issues while exploring a range of emerging data collection and analytic techniques.
	Lectures focuses on the fundamentals of Remote Sensing providing exposure to emerging geospatial analytic tools (Google Earth Engine) with an emphasis on appropriate data handling and processing, as well as applied spatial analytic methods. Students will apply these concepts through weekly workshops investigating real-world spatial problems focused on managing natural and built environments. Students will conduct an individual innovative GIS/Remote Sensing project, the result of which will be communicated through a written report and oral seminar</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Making democracy work in societies afflicted by deep ideological, cultural or ethnic divisions is a challenge for both new and established democracies. This unit will introduce students to the academic debate and examine the causes of social polarization, and examine different approaches to political reform for the management of social cleavages. Taking a broad view of multi-ethnic societies in Asia and the Western world, it will compare the relative success of democracy in the world's largest Islamic country, Indonesia, with its more developed but less democratic neighbours. It will also examine cases such as Taiwan, in which national identity is an existential question. The class will then move on to the West, and examine efforts to promote stable democracy in Bosnia and Northern Ireland. It will conclude by offering a comparative case study of two established democracies, the United States and Australia – both continental-sized immigrant societies which have developed quite different political cultures. The course will conclude with an examination of what approaches to political amelioration and de-polarization work in different environments, and the challenges of adopting appropriate reforms.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to mathematical logic: the study of formal languages and their mathematical properties. The first part of the unit focuses on classical first-order logic and its metatheory: we discuss the interpretation of first-order logic and how to construct proofs within it. We then show that any such proof yields a valid argument (soundness) and that there is a proof for every valid argument (completeness). The rest of the unit discusses some more advanced topics in logic. These may include non-classical logics (e.g., modal logics, multi-valued logics, fuzzy logics, intuitionist logics, relevance logics, second-order logic), model-theoretic features of first-order logic (e.g., the compactness and Löwenheim-Skolem theorems), as well as an introduction to computability, recursion, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts A and B must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the year.
The Doctor of Medicine (MD) course is based around six themes of Professional, Leader, Advocate, Clinician, Educator and Scholar. This unit provides teaching in all of these themes within the clinical attachments and related teaching in Year 3 of the MD course. This includes eight-week duration clinical placements in surgery and psychiatry, internal medicine, general practice and ophthalmology, paediatrics and child health, and womens' and infants' health. Students undertake clinical care of patients under the supervision of experienced clinicians in a real clinical environment including ward rounds, operating theatre experience, outpatient clinics, emergency department attachments, community practices and other clinical encounters. Students engage in small group learning sessions to discuss evidence-based practice in related clinical disciplines in hospital and community health contexts. Students are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes gained in context within these clinical rotations.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students usually commence the unit in semester 1, but semester 2 enrolment can be negotiated if circumstances require this. Students work independently on the unit, which has no lecture or tutorial components. Students produce, under supervision, an independent research project in an area relevant to their specialist master's degree. By preparing, designing, analysing and reporting this research, the students develop skills critical to future employment as scientist-practitioners. In particular, they achieve the competency to review the literature relevant to a problem in their field, design and conduct an appropriate study and report it to high professional standards. They also advance their general abilities to interpret and evaluate the research of others. They become familiar with the ethical considerations bearing on research in their field and in preparing applications to human ethics committees.
Potential enrolment into PSYC5210/PSYC5211 requires completion of all coursework and placements of the Masters component, and withdrawal from the PhD component. Students must also first inform the School of Psychological Science ([email protected]) whether they intend to complete the dissertation in one semester or two semesters. Finally, students must simultaneously submit a dissertation completion plan schedule approved by their dissertation supervisor that is consistent with their enrolment intention.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is the culmination of the technology sequence in the Architecture major. As such, it is thought of as an extension and further development of ARCT2030 Materials and Small Constructions. Through a similarly analytical methodology it introduces students to construction techniques of greater complexity, with an emphasis on architecture as an integrated manifestation of structure, body, skin and building services. 
Topics include architectural and structural analysis, materials and sections; fire services and safety; hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems, and the types and applicability of constructional systems to different architectural expressions. 
The unit generates an understanding of the integration of structures and services in medium- to large-scale buildings. The vehicle for this is the combined effect of weekly lectures and workshops. Lectures investigate and critically analyse a number of selected buildings highlighting architectural, structural and technical aspects that pertain to different materials and construction techniques. They also illustrate specialist drawings produced by consultants, including structures and services. In the workshops students conduct an analysis of selected buildings, to identify the relationships between architecture, space, structure and technology. Such analysis evolves weekly through progressive reviews with a tutor at each workshop and it culminates in two submissions during the semester.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit develops students' proficiency in advanced German reading and writing. Its focus is on particular aspects of language study such as translation of newspaper articles, intensive grammar studies, development of advanced intercultural awareness and conventions of academic writing. The unit allows students to study German texts in great detail and to develop their written expression in both German and English. It leads to a better understanding of the specific language/translation problems posed by a selection of texts and of the techniques required to solve them, while sharpening students' writing, speaking and presentation skills, as well as their critical information literacy and interpersonal skills. Each text is chosen to illustrate a specific area of language use in particular, such as reported speech, syntax, tenses or collocations; or a specific area of translation practice such as accuracy, audience, explicitness and appropriateness; or a specific area of contrastive language study such as sentence structure, verbal/noun structures and register.
Students gain an increased level of competency in all four macro skills—listening to, speaking, reading and writing German corresponding to proficiency Levels B2/C1 and upwards of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen). They develop an increased awareness of intercultural understanding and of language learning, as well as research skills and communication strategies and increased awareness of how languages work in general.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts 1 to 4 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students usually commence the unit in semester 1, but semester 2 enrolment can be negotiated if circumstances require this. Students work independently on the unit, which has no lecture or tutorial components. Students produce, under supervision, an independent research project in an area relevant to their specialist master's degree. By preparing, designing, analysing and reporting this research, the students develop skills critical to future employment as scientist-practitioners. In particular, they achieve the competency to review the literature relevant to a problem in their field, design and conduct an appropriate study and report it to high professional standards. They also advance their general abilities to interpret and evaluate the research of others. They become familiar with the ethical considerations bearing on research in their field and in preparing applications to human ethics committees.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit presents a macroscopic treatment of thermodynamics from an engineering perspective, beginning with definitions of properties, forms of energy and systems.  The behaviour of ideal gases is discussed, along with the use of the compressibility factor.  The 1st law of thermodynamics is applied to both open and closed systems, leading to the steady flow energy equation and the definition of enthalpy.  The behaviour of liquid-vapour systems and use of property tables and charts are discussed.  The 2nd law of thermodynamics, the property entropy, and the Carnot cycle are introduced.  The 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics are then applied to typical thermodynamic systems, for example internal combustion engines, using models such as the Otto cycle, Diesel cycle, and Brayton cycle.  Issues surrounding the use of such thermodynamic systems, for example fuel sources, thermal efficiency, pollution and emissions form part of this system analysis.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The objective of this unit is to provide an introduction to dynamic structural response analysis of single degree of freedom (SDOF) and multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) structures to earthquake, blast, wave and man-made dynamic loads. Topics include the free-vibration analysis; vibration frequency and mode shape; damping of structures; harmonic, periodic and arbitrary dynamic loads; estimation of blast, earthquake, wave and man-made dynamic loads on structures; design of structures against these dynamic loads; discussions of the Australian Seismic Loading Code (AS1170.4 2007); discussions on blast-resistant design according to TM5-1300, P-I curve, and man-made (traffic, blasting, soil compacting and pile-driving) ground vibrations and their effects on structures. Students are expected to develop the ability to apply knowledge of fundamental theory of structural dynamics to dynamic structural response analysis and design; achieve technical competence and practical skills in structural dynamics; and undertake problem identification, formulation and solution.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the study of performance practices and the performance of repertoire from a range of historical periods with a special focus on stylistically appropriate techniques and conventions. Aspects covered may include notational conventions and their interpretation; practical and theoretical treatises and their application to historically-informed performance; historical and social contexts and their impact on musical composition and performance; as well as instruments and their specialised techniques. Through lectures and practical workshops, students explore the basis for historically-informed practices and their practical application in contemporary contexts. Unit topics focus on the music of one historical period. These topics may include Baroque/Classical (seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries), Romantic (nineteenth to early twentieth centuries) and contemporary (twentieth to twenty-first centuries).
This is an elective unit in the Specialist Music Studies major in the Bachelor of Arts degree.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The law of securities regulation pertains to the rules of the public marketplace in which these products can be sold. The private marketplace for such products is, to a larger degree, unregulated (or deregulated or re-regulated in some cases) and is better studied in the context of units covering the areas of banking, securities, commercial law and international finance. This unit examines the regulation of Australian equity capital markets, with a particular focus on the ASX. Topics such as the ASX admission process, continuous disclosure, fundraising (including both initial public offerings and secondary raisings), common transactional issues, and the investigation and enforcement powers and process of ASX and ASIC, will be covered. This unit provides a blend of theory and practical learning whereby student will gain a working knowledge of the of the relevant sections of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act), ASX Listing Rules and Guidance Notes, and ASIC regulatory guidance which largely regulate Australia's equity capital markets.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit reinforces key concepts from CITS2200 Data Structures and Algorithms, and extends them to consider algorithms in the context of autonomous programs, or agents. We introduce ideas such as decision making, goal-directed behaviour, heuristic search, action selection, performance (self-evaluation), expected return and learning. These concepts are explored in the context of artificial intelligence or 'intelligent agents'.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Students investigate the agricultural production environmental impact nexus, in a real world context by either participating in a field trip to Vietnam or working on a one-on-one basis with an individual UWA academic advisor on developing a case study.  For students participating in the field trip, the focus can be at the project management level, working with office based staff; primarily in the field via extension and data collection work; or a combination of both.  For students not participating in the field, the case study context is framed around an active project at The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture Vietnam office, which may overlap with some of the field trip based projects, and students still have the opportunity to participate in skype project meetings, and work on real world collaborations, including with Vietnamese CIAT researchers working in partnership with UWA staff.  
All students, regardless of field trip participation, are exposed to international research organisations and the process of developing a research project, assessing the risks associated with the delivery of that research project, and primary data collection in the field.
Through a process of reflective practice, students develop an understanding of the practical challenges of implementing effective environmental and natural resource management policy in a developing country context, and understand the implications of policy changes on rural communities.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In Financial Accounting and Reporting, students apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or local equivalents, and regulatory and ethical requirements to account for and report on a diverse range of business transactions and events. 
The unit will advance students' technical knowledge of financial accounting and reporting and develop broader professional and business skills in problem solving, critical thinking, research, evaluation and communication. 
Through practical case studies and scenarios, students are required to apply the accounting standards and use professional judgement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment of transactions and events, identify the impacts of those transactions and events on financial statements, and prepare financial statements and related note disclosures. As part of these practical cases studies and scenarios students will be required to identify appropriate courses of action for complex ethical dilemmas within a financial reporting context. Students will also be required to keep abreast of new accounting standards as well as revisions and amendments to existing standards, evaluating these changes and their implications to provide clear, concise and relevant advice.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This Honours unit provides a unique opportunity to apply and further develop your knowledge and professional skills through experiential learning in an art gallery, museum, or art centre. Working closely with the unit coordinator to secure a placement, and then with a nominated mentor from the host institution, you will be immersed in the day-to-day operations of collecting institutions or art centres. Whilst the exact nature of your placement activities will vary according to the type of institution, you will be able to pursue your individual interests by working either on a focus project such as an exhibition, or by working across a range of gallery practices such as registration, object-based research, cataloguing and archiving, or educational/public programming.
A number of placements in remote or regional art centres may be available each year, with additional support (including limited financial support) available to students accepted into these placements. Please contact the unit coordinator to discuss opportunities and funding available for this year.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit increases students' awareness and critical thinking skills related to a diverse range of ethical dilemmas. The unit is designed to arm students with thinking skills and knowledge in ethics to enable them to respond in respectful ways in the workplace and in their personal lives to a variety of ethical issues. As such, this is a multidisciplinary unit involving Philosophy; Animal Biology; Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology; History; and Pharmacology across three faculties of this University (Faculty of Arts, Business, Law and Education; Faculty of Science; and Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences). Teaching in Philosophy includes different approaches to ethical theory and the code of ethics relating to various fields of study or professions. Humans interact with animals in a range of areas including research, teaching, as pets and livestock. Animal Biology explores animal ethics and welfare using current dilemmas such as genetically modified animals, the use of animals in research, farming systems and entertainment industries. Teaching in Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology highlights issues involving human reproduction. History focusses on issues such as war, tyrannicide and whistleblowing. Pharmacology explores issues such as drug discovery, development, marketing and use in developed and developing nations. Guest speakers also contribute to occasional lectures in the unit. It is envisaged that such speakers offer a life and/or workplace view on current ethical dilemmas. Speakers are selected from across the University and surrounding areas. Visitors from interstate or overseas may also be invited to contribute in this manner.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Sex, Gender, and the Body in the Greco-Roman World</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>What roles did men and women play in Greek and Roman society? How many genders were there in antiquity? What did ancient writers think about heterosexual and homosexual relationships? How did ancient doctors conceptualise the human body? Were ancient Christian attitudes towards sex different from those of non-Christians of the same period? This unit addresses these questions, as well as others, by introducing students to ancient attitudes towards sex, gender, and conceptions of the human body from Classical Greece through to the advent of Late Antiquity. 
In the first part of the unit, students will investigate ancient sexualities and attitudes towards sex through a close reading of poetry (such as poems by Sappho, Catullus, Ovid), and by interpreting the material culture from the ancient world (erotic art, graffiti). In the second part of the unit, students will consider constructions of gender during the early centuries CE, using the ancient Greek novels as a starting point. Students will investigate not only how the ethical vocabulary of Greece and Rome was heavily gendered, but also how it evolved over time. In the final component, students will investigate how conceptions of the human body changed from Classical to Late antiquity, by examining art, medical texts, and also the writings of Christian theologians. 
Ultimately, this unit challenges students to think more deeply about the differences and similarities between ancient and modern approaches gender, sexuality, and the body, and the utility of employing contemporary theoretical frameworks for interpreting the ancient evidence.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The unit will be taught in a flipped classroom mode to encourage an active learning experience. Students engage with online learning materials (e.g. videos, readings) in preparation for activities in seminars and laboratories, which will be continuously assessed throughout semester. 
The objective of this unit is to provide students with an understanding of the concepts and methods used in molecular biology and to prepare students to apply this knowledge to solve problems, as well as to analyse and evaluate experimental results. The unit extends many of the topics introduced in SCIE1106 Molecular Biology of the Cell and BIOC2001 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Cell. These topics include DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; gene and genome structure and function, the regulation of gene expression, cellular quality control mechanisms in RNA and protein synthesis; bioinformatics; recombinant DNA technology, membrane-less organelles and genetic engineering. In practicals, students will learn manual skills required to prepare and perform a gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR. Students will learn how to document and report experimental outcomes. Students will further learn how to analyse and critically evaluate experimental results and how to avoid and troubleshoot experimental problems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This practical unit draws together students from different levels of musical experience at pre-tertiary level, and consolidates essential musicianship and technical skills to underpin the input of music to electronic hardware and software via traditional (piano) keyboard.  Whether students are experienced keyboard players or beginners, they will develop basic keyboard proficiency in a contemporary music idiom, and begin to develop skills in keyboard improvisation.  Because each student will commence at a different level of proficiency, a personalised creative contract will form the basis of both instruction and examination of this keyboard component.
The unit also allows students to develop skills in elements of technical performance skills such as the assembly of various elements of technology for music performance (e.g. microphones, amplifiers, speakers, other electronic components, hardware, software).  
This unit prepares students for the next unit in the sequence, MUSC2455 Performance Skills 2.  
The corequisite unit MUSC1591 Music Large Ensemble 1 will typically be as a member of the Symphonic Chorus in order to develop awareness and experience in how the human voice can be applied in large ensembles and acoustic circumstances.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Understanding the relationship between a programming language and the contemporary operating systems on which it executes is central to developing many skills in Computer Science. This unit introduces the standard C programming language, on which many other programming languages and systems are based, through a study of core operating system services including input and output, memory management and file systems. The C language is introduced through discussions on basic topics like data types, variables, expressions, control structures, scoping rules, functions and parameter passing. More advanced topics like C's run-time environment, system calls, dynamic memory allocation, pointers and recursion are presented in the context of operating system services related to process execution, memory management and file systems. The importance of process scheduling, memory management and interprocess communication in modern operating systems is discussed in the context of operating system support for multiprogramming. Laboratory and practical class work place a strong focus on the practical application of fundamental programming concepts, with examples designed to compare and contrast many key features of contemporary operating systems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Since the earliest period of the cinema, avant-gardist filmmakers have explored metaphoric correlations between the visual image and music and poetry. The polemic of the early Dada and surrealist works by Leger, Clair, Dulac and Bunuel/Dali led to a more concerted exploration of the expressive nature of avant-garde film by Deren, Brakhage, Anger (and others) during the early period of the New American Cinema. Through lectures, screenings and tutorial based discussion, this unit examines avant-gardist imagist films and critical texts that developed in the interwar and postwar periods. The unit also provides students involved in film/video production with a conceptual and historical framework of ideas.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In the late nineteenth century the nation-states of Europe controlled the destiny of the world. The continent's extraordinary achievements, the unprecedented harnessing of nature through science, technology and industry, the flourishing of the arts and the possession of the power, the will and the ruthlessness to found new Europes across the globe, confirmed to most Europeans that they were at the forefront of human progress, the vanguard of world history. The European trading, monetary and financial system was welding the world into the first globalized farm, factory and market.  At home, as the mass of Europe's people became or struggled for entitlement as citizens, democracy and constitutional government seemed everywhere to be on the horizon. Peace reigned. Fifty years later the continent lay in ruins. Inter-national, civil, class, ethnic and racial war had swept through Europe leaving behind devastation that would have been unthinkable only a generation before. Dictatorship and tyranny marked the politics of the era. Revolutions, genocides and the unparalleled will to annihilate people and property had seemingly overtaken the Old World like a gigantic natural disaster. Yet the tens of millions of dead and the squandering of so much of Europe's extraordinary capital and heritage had been a self-inflicted calamity. From 1945, chastened, weakened and horrified, Europeans began the slow process of rebuilding, but now in a world that had been irrevocably transformed. 
Covering topics such as the First World War, the Russian Revolution, Fascism, the rise of Europe's totalitarian dictatorships, the Spanish Civil War, the Holocaust and the horror and the grandeur of the Second World War, this unit investigates the baleful journey of European history between 1890 and 1945, when the continent went to hell and back.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the use of key stable and radiogenic isotope systems for unravelling Earth's evolution. The unit examines the basic principles behind nucleosynthesis, radioactive decay and stable isotope fractionation as a basis for exploring the two main applications of isotope geochemistry, namely geochronology and the isotope tracing of geological processes. Emphasis is placed on the petrogenesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks, as recorders of the dynamic history of Earth's mantle and continental crust, with implications for the evolution of the atmosphere and oceans, and on understanding the sources of metals in ore deposits. The use of short-lived 'extinct' radiogenic isotope systems for deducing the timing of very early planetary processes is also outlined. The unit includes an overview of the techniques and instruments used for measuring isotope ratios in geological samples with some practical work.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers detailed discussion of advanced reactor designs as are employed on process plants. It considers fluidised beds in detail (e.g. as used for waste combustion) as well as covering bioreactors (sewage farms are discussed). It also considers various aspects of catalysis including effectiveness factors, catalyst deactivation and catalyst characterisation, as well as corrosion engineering in the context of undesirable reactions on a chemical processing plant. Reaction engineering is what ultimately differentiates chemical engineering from other engineering disciplines. Here it cements skills in reaction design, looks at more detailed reactor designs involving complex fluid flow or complex kinetics and finally considers catalysts in terms of their characterisation and their longevity.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This MBA elective unit is concerned with project management, and for managers and strategic leaders of individual projects, as programs for realising strategic change objectives and outcomes, and as a portfolio for executing strategy. It covers life cycles of project, program and portfolio management, from idea, business case, program and portfolio development, through to delivery and realisation of strategic benefits and value for stakeholders. Projects and strategic initiatives are increasingly bridging the gap between strategy to execution, complementary to strategic management and organisational change and transformation. The unit addresses challenges of accelerating change, globalisation, competition, and complexity; digital disruption and transformation; the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning; the future of projectised work; and the agility sought by organisations seeking to thrive and contribute to sustainable development. Topics covered may include: project, program and portfolio standards, practices and tools; agile projects and programs, at scale; their frameworks, life cycles, governance, assurance, practice maturity, ethics, sustainability, and benefits realisation; and the combination of project management, leadership, and strategy and business acumen that project managers and strategic leaders must cultivate to succeed and deliver value for their organisations and society.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The University of Western Australia Law Review (UWALR) is the oldest university law journal in Australia, being first published in 1948. The UWALR is published twice annually and currently has a hard copy circulation and is included in the Australasian Legal Scholarship Library which is one of the largest collections of legal scholarship on the web. It provides a forum for the airing of articles on topics of current legal significance and practical notes on Australian case and statute law. 
The UWALR is edited by a Student Editorial Board under the supervision of a senior member of the academic staff and benefits from the advice of a distinguished Editorial Advisory Board. The Student Editorial Board is usually selected from among the top students of the graduating year. The supporting Editorial Advisory Board comprises distinguished scholars, legal practitioners and members of the judiciary from Australia and several other countries. 
The task of student editors involves assisting with the evaluation of items submitted for publication such as articles, notes and book reviews, and editing those items and checking print proofs, as well as writing a piece for publication. Evaluation involves an assessment based upon the student's own analysis assisted by referee reports. Students are required to prepare short reports on each article assigned to them, in the nature of an official referee report. Such reports should include the student's opinion on the merits, topicality and originality of any article or note submitted for publication.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts 1 to 4 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students usually commence the unit in semester 1, but semester 2 enrolment can be negotiated if circumstances require this. Students work independently on the unit, which has no lecture or tutorial components. Students produce, under supervision, an independent research project in an area relevant to their specialist master's degree. By preparing, designing, analysing and reporting this research, the students develop skills critical to future employment as scientist-practitioners. In particular, they achieve the competency to review the literature relevant to a problem in their field, design and conduct an appropriate study and report it to high professional standards. They also advance their general abilities to interpret and evaluate the research of others. They become familiar with the ethical considerations bearing on research in their field and in preparing applications to human ethics committees.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Dispute Resolution</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Despite the fact that only a very small percentage of cases proceed to trial, legal education has traditionally emphasised adversarial dispute resolution processes. Yet there are numerous ways for people to resolve their disputes without recourse to lawyers and courts, and now the legal fraternity is embracing these deeper ways of dealing with conflict. This unit explores several methods of dispute resolution as a comparison to litigation and aims to seek a balance between the uses of the different forms. It investigates the various dispute resolution processes including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and mixed processes, to gain familiarity with the processes, rudimentary skills in using them and some experience in choosing the most appropriate process to use to resolve a particular dispute.
Students are able to (1) analyse the nature and cause of disputes; (2) understand the various forms of dispute resolution including litigation and how they work in practice; (3) advise clients on the appropriate use of different dispute resolution methods; (4) understand how to engage in constructive negotiation, mediation and arbitration; and (5) critically evaluate and research the various issues that arise in ADR practice.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The ocean energy sector has historically been a strong contributor to the Australian economy.  This unit will equip students with the necessary knowledge and tools to (i) identify and characterise the range of different ocean energy resources and their connection to other oceans activities, (ii), analyse and demonstrate the needs for a transition to renewable energy, and (iii) establish the preliminary elements of engineering solutions required to address ocean energy challenges.
 
The unit will cover all ocean energy resources within the Australian and worldwide context and will strongly focus on ocean renewable energy (wave, tidal and offshore wind) and other future energy sources (such as hydrogen and marine biofuels).
The unit will provide an overview of the building blocks for harnessing ocean energy resources, the stages of the life cycle from conception to decommissioning and the complex multi-disciplinary nature of offshore renewable energy projects. The feasibility and development as well as the construction and commissioning stages in particular offer opportunities to develop an overview understanding of science and engineering considerations related to offshore renewable energy projects. Aspects such as economics, environmental assessments and regulatory frameworks will be included in case studies</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on advanced concepts in agricultural and applied economics and uses a formal approach to concepts. Real-world applications are used as a motivation but rather than the interpretation of results, it is the derivation of results that is emphasised. The focus of the first half of the unit is on deriving the key insights from modelling individuals as utility maximising agents and firms as profit maximising entities. Applications that allow the measurement of welfare gains from trade are emphasised. Models of production under discrete time and continuous time are then considered, as are production efficiency measures. The final part of the unit focuses on the theory that underlies models that seek to explain economic behaviours under different market conditions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from Korean 4, further developing students' overall Korean language ability to an advanced level. The unit expands students' competency and existing skills by focusing  on complex linguistic structures and expressions used in both spoken and written Korean and it further develops awareness of different forms and styles of written language. It also fosters a deeper understanding of Korean culture and society through reading authentic language materials contextualised within the students' social setting. Students are requested to reflect upon Korean contemporary social issues, writing essays in Korean.
Students are expected to achieve a high level of skill in writing in a range of different text typologies, using specific expressions and style. They are also expected to give formal presentations or sustain conversation in Korean about issues related to Korean culture and society. By doing so, students reach not only a high level of proficiency in formal speech, reading and writing, but also a detailed knowledge of contemporary achievements and issues in present day Korea.
Successful completion of this unit aims to bring students to the equivalent of upper Level 3/ lower Level 4 of the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit offers an introduction to the world of collecting and curating art from historical, theoretical and practice-based perspectives. The evolution of modern-day museums and art galleries is traced to the early modern 'chamber of wonders' and the establishment of large national institutions, starting with the British Museum in the mid-eighteenth century. Key themes include how gallery displays reinforce the public's perception of canons of art or how they suggest the boundaries between fine art and ethnography? And what particular issues do Australian collections face today? In addition, students receive an introduction to aspect of collection management, from acquisition policies or exhibition design to museum education programs. Students receive the opportunity to label and hang objects in a model room, to critically explore aspects of current museological practice and to carry out research on these. Site visits to museums (including the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery or the Berndt Museum of Anthropology) and other local collections constitute a major element of this unit, affording students a ‘look behind the scenes' and the possibility to acquire basic object handling skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores the visual representation and sensorial experience of Paris as the quintessential modern city. By engaging the unique built environment and museum collections of Paris, this study abroad unit contextualises art and architectural history through on-site learning and affords students the opportunity to investigate spatial and visual concepts through direct experience.  Primarily, students examine how large-scale city planning reshaped the spaces and culture of Paris in the nineteenth century.  Students scrutinise how acts of ‘creative destruction' altered Paris after 1850 and analyse how art, literature and politics responded to these changes. The unit traces the transformation of urban spaces over time and also considers how the modern framework of the nineteenth century persists to the present day. The unit encourages students to research Parisian streets, spaces, and works of art through a variety of representational tools, making use of both on-site writing and drawing as well as online resources in order to understand how this icon of urban modernity has been reshaped and reimagined over the last two-hundred years.  Ultimately, the unit presents Paris as a site of living history and offers students the unique opportunity to learn about France's built environment and visual culture in situ.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Students develop an ability to read, understand, analyse and apply the law of contract through the study of decided cases and contractual terms. As most of the applicable law studied in Contract is common law case law this material is the primary focus of the unit. Students are also introduced to legislation that impacts on contract law in Australia. The unit begins with an examination of the rules relating to the formation of contracts and concepts of offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, privity and contract formalities. Students then study incorporation and construction of contractual terms and implication of terms. They continue mapping the life of a contract by investigating how contracts come to an end through agreement, performance, breach and repudiation, and frustration of contract. Although contract remedies are studied in a dedicated Remedies unit, students are introduced to restitutionary claims for unjust enrichment. They study the provisions in national consumer legislation (the Australian Consumer Law) that impact on the law of contract, in particular the law of misleading or deceptive conduct. Students analyse case law, extract legal principles from judicial decisions and clearly state them, and analyse and solve hypothetical legal problems relating to the topics covered.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores the range of decision making and behaviours of buyers and consumers in the exchange process. Specific topics include attitudinal and behavioural theories. The unit is fundamental to marketing as it provides the student with an understanding of how and why buyers and consumers make decisions about their choices in the marketplace. The models and theories used in this unit largely come from marketing and psychology fields. Specific applications in retailing, promotion, pricing and branding are covered along with issues concerning ‘targeting' and the ‘de-marketing' of consumer ‘vices'. The unit addresses both commercial as well as government and not-for-profit contexts. The unit provides a strong foundation for understanding consumers and developing marketing strategies in these contexts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit explores the main forms of insecurity in contemporary Africa, one of the world's least secure regions, and examines the various actors and institutions that either threaten security or attempt to provide and manage it. (In)security is defined broadly to include military and non-military dimensions—such as armed conflict, gender-based violence and political repression; population displacement; poverty, health and underdevelopment; environmental change and natural resources competition—at the human, state, and regional levels in Africa. It examines historical causes of insecurity, including European colonialism, Cold War competition, and the nature of the post-colonial state. Relations of security governance at different levels are explored—between people and their governments, between African states in the regional context (including via the African Union), and between external actors and Africa (including the United Nations and International Criminal Court). The unit draws upon particular case studies, such as Mali, Darfur, Libya, Somalia, DR Congo and Rwanda.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Humans place significant pressures on our environment.  Population increases cause the release of contaminants, the need to rehabilitate degraded environments as well as the need to ensure nutritious food  production with greater efficiency.  One central requirement to these environmental pressures is the need to monitor factors such as environmental degradation, the trajectory of rehabilitation efforts and the ability to measure the health of food productions systems.  This unit focuses on the recent biotechnology solutions to these requirements, from utilising microbial based toxicity sensors, the  construction of highly specific biosensors for detecting key environmental agents through to whole system sensing using chemical, biological and ecological approaches.  Particular attention is placed upon novel biological based strategies to detect pollutants in soils and water courses, measuring the release from toxicity in rehabilitation efforts and the adoption of targeted biosensors.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit traces global developments in art and material culture through a series of case studies focusing on the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries. The unit is not a survey of global art but instead concentrates on the increasing globalisation and its impact on the production and reception of art across different cultures in Latin America, South and East Asia, Africa and Europe. Exploring issues such as national vs transnational, cultural encounter, ethnography, cross-cultural exchange and cultural transfer (acculturation, transculturation, hybridization, etc.), this unit critically investigates what constitutes ‘globalisation' and the ‘global' in art and culture. Simultaneously, we will survey current theoretical and historiographical discourses regarding Global art history or World art history and critically revaluate art history as a (Western) discipline. The unit is designed to stimulate critical thinking and writing, shape research skills and develop the capacity to speak to multiple audiences.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the international politics of climate change. The unit first looks briefly at theories of environmental politics, using concepts from international relations and environmental politics, to introduce students to debates on how should we think about the planet and its politics. It then introduces the United Nations process for dealing with climate change – the UNFCCC. It then looks at key actors that participate in climate politics, including states, intergovernmental organisations, transnational corporations and social movements, and how these actors clash to produce political and environmental outcomes. It closes with case studies of environmental regions – specifically the Himalayan watershed, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Arctic and Antarctic, and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Students are introduced to the politics of climate change, why it is so hard to deal with, and begin to think through what political solutions to environmental problems might look like.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The unit has an emphasis on consolidating learning from previous units in order for students to enter professional practice with relevant knowledge, skills and future professional development plans. This unit includes an analysis of knowledge and practice approaches that are commonly required for working in social work settings, such as poverty; homelessness; health and disability; substance misuse; gendered violence; sexual abuse; crime and offending; out of home care; caregiving; grief, loss and palliative care. A key overarching framework is trauma-informed social work viewed through an Indigenous cultural lens. Knowledge of intersectionality, the impact of inequalities on individuals and groups, partnership working, leadership, and working across disciplines are incorporated into the knowledge and practice learning. There is an explicit research-led and evidence-informed curriculum for this unit which allows students to focus on particular areas of interest. Assessments include two components of a research project which build on each other and allow the student to specialise in a practice and core curriculum outcome area of interest to them. The weekly blogs will relate to an ongoing case study which will touch on a broad variety of social work contexts.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Innovations in Legal Practice Management</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is an elective offered to students in the Doctor of Judicial Science. The way lawyers and law firms run their business and deliver their services is rapidly changing. It is critical that law graduates are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in future legal practice. This unit seeks to provide students with an understanding of the professional, ethical and business framework within which legal services are provided, and appreciation of how the provision of legal services is continually evolving in response to client need, regulation and technological development. The unit addresses three key themes. First, it explores an understanding of the business of law, including the economics of running a legal practice and the development of ethical business processes and strategies. Second, it considers the role of people and practice management in the delivery of legal services. This includes consideration of how to recruit, engage, upskill and lead staff in an ethical, client-focused and changing legal environment. Third, it considers the role of technology in the transformation of how lawyers and law firms perform legal work and deliver legal services. The unit will provide students with an understanding of the business of law as distinct from the service of law. It will provide students with an understanding of the key concepts of legal project management, leadership, strategy, pricing, business development, transformation + innovation and change management, specifically within a legal context.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Much work in contemporary political theory, together with much real-world political contestation, has to do with questions of social justice. This course surveys the most influential accounts of the nature of social justice developed over the past half-century. It also considers their application to a series of real-world controversies, including the rights of the disabled, private education, redistributive taxation, global poverty, immigration, freedom of speech, gender equality, pornography, civil disobedience, and democracy.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Introduction to Critical Thinking</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The fundamental questions each human being faces are—What should I believe? What should I do? Asking those questions implies that some answers are better than others and the better answers are those supported by better reasons. Answering them requires the ability to distinguish good reasons for believing or doing things from bad ones. In this unit, students acquire the concepts and develop the skills involved in analysing, creating and evaluating arguments for and against beliefs and actions. They learn to apply these skills to real cases from philosophy and other disciplines. Because the ability to think and argue clearly and convincingly is central not just to philosophy but to university studies in general, a wide variety of material is studied, and many students find the unit's content of immense value later on, both within the University and later in employment and their subsequent areas of specialisation.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Periodontics Theory III Part 1</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is the third-year theory unit in Periodontics in the Doctor of Clinical Dentistry course. The unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The unit covers new material where a comprehensive review of all aspects of osseointegrated implantology are reviewed. Students undertake a current periodontal literature review. The unit studies the processes of examination, diagnosis, planning and treatment of patients in respect to periodontal disease. The linkage of periodontics with all other dental disciplines is established especially in the field of treatment planning.
Teaching Methods: Prescribed readings, seminars, tutorials, discussions, and student presentations.
Assessment: The assessment in these two semester theory units consists of a combination of formative and summative methods.
Formative methods are: active participation in seminars and presentations from other registrars and staff and presentations of assignments (periodontal/implant topics; case presentations and journal clubs). The assignments (written essay; presentation; journal club and case presentation) should demonstrate original, individual input from the student with critical thinking.
Additional formative methods to monitor the progression of the students during the semester are:
DOPS (Direct observation of procedural skills) , CbD (case based discussion) and Mini-CEX (Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise) forms. Although these are mainly used in a clinical setting they can contribute to assess the Registrar and give immediate feedback on both clinical and theoretical aspects
Summative methods:
At the end of the year an exam with two to three internal examiners will be carried out as below:
A three hour written exam (40%)
A one hour oral Exam (40%)
critical appraisal of a scientific article (20%)
The exam at th end of the year will be carried out inc conjunction with the Royal of Australasian College of Dentists and Oral Surgeons membership.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>At the core of most computer applications is the storage and retrieval of information. The way that the stored data is structured has a strong impact on what can be retrieved, how quickly it can be retrieved and how much space it occupies. The use of generic structures, or abstract data types (ADTs), to encapsulate the data also facilitates software engineering principles of independent modification, extension and re-use. This unit studies the specification, implementation and time-and-space performance of a range of commonly used ADTs and corresponding algorithms in an object-oriented setting.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Global Inequalities and Population Change: Transformation and Crisis</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Inequality within and between nation states has never been greater, and is on the rise. This presents challenges to our ability to advance just and equitable long-term developmental trajectories and design effective policy responses to recurrent crises. This unit equips students with a conceptual toolkit of critical reasoning and analytical skills, as well as access to empirical evidence with which to understand the economic and demographic transformations that underpin the geography of uneven development across time, and at a range of scales (from the global to the individual).  
It takes a geographical approach to examining the relationship between changing patterns of uneven development, the economic, demographic and cultural processes generating those spatial patterns, and the social and spatial structures through which inequalities are produced and sustained.  Viewed from the global perspective of interdependent national and regional economies, the focus is on shifting regimes of accumulation, restructuring spatial divisions of labour, global systems of trade, and entrenched drivers of poverty. At the local scale, the unit also considers how individuals, communities and ethnic minorities in lower-income countries navigate livelihoods within these broader economic constraints, and how the lives of the wealthy and poor are entwined through both local and globally interdependent systems. 
The unit then turns to the dynamics of rapid global population change over the last 200 years in relation to economic drivers of differential inequality. Students will analyse the key components of, and debates about, population change (fertility, mortality and migration) in the context of uneven development globally. We will explore the ways in which inequality relates to comparative population structures (e.g. in ageing vs youthful societies) and the implications of increasingly uneven distribution of the world's population in urban areas. Here again, the context of economic, demographic, and cultural change forms the backdrop for exploring individual and local-level choices and actions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers detailed discussion of advanced reactor designs as are employed on process plants. It considers fluidised beds in detail (e.g. as used for waste combustion) as well as covering bioreactors (sewage farms are discussed). It also considers various aspects of catalysis including effectiveness factors, catalyst deactivation and catalyst characterisation, as well as corrosion engineering in the context of undesirable reactions on a chemical processing plant. Reaction engineering is what ultimately differentiates chemical engineering from other engineering disciplines. Here it cements skills in reaction design, looks at more detailed reactor designs involving complex fluid flow or complex kinetics and finally considers catalysts in terms of their characterisation and their longevity.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>The objectives of MICR5842 Infection and Immunity are to familiarize students with the molecular and cellular basis of the immune system, to understand how the immune response protects humans from infection with viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms, and the effects of age on immune responses. The interaction between infectious agents and the human host is explored, particularly with regard to the integrity of the host immune  system  and  strategies  used  by  infectious  agents  to  evade  immune responses. 
Students will acquire the capacity to understand how pathogen-specific immune responses contribute to disease in the host, and how immune-based treatment and prevention strategies combat infectious disease. In addition they will learn to analyse published studies which describe investigations of the interaction between pathogen and host immune responses. Practical skills in technologies widely used in immunology laboratories will be acquired in Laboratory classes and eTutorials.
All parts of the unit require compulsory attendance (laboratories, seminars and tutorials), except for the 14 lectures which are delivered in the first 2 weeks of semester 1. However, attendance at the lectures is highly recommended.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the entire human history of Australia from first human colonisation ~65,000 years ago and through the arrival of Makassan traders and later European voyagers and colonists in the last 1000 years. This unit pairs theory such as culture history, processualism and post-processualism with informative case studies such as the Lake Mungo burials, human adaptations to climate change, rock art, colonial contact and Indigenous knowledge. Each case study is examined in terms of methods used, personalities involved, findings made, and how that research has informed our understanding of Australia's past. Contemporary issues such as heritage management, DNA analysis, repatriation and museum studies help students understand future trends in Australian archaeology.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit traces the development of major concepts in anthropological and sociological theory from Enlightenment schemas of social evolution to the modernist framework of structuralism. Topics treated may include, among other themes, the notion of the 'primitive', unilinear and multilinear frameworks of societal evolution and their impacts, materialism and idealism in social theory, attitudes toward the position of women in different societies, the rise and demise of varieties of functionalism, debates over the definition of culture, the relationship of anthropology and history, cultural ecology and the reconsideration of Marxist models. Consideration of seminal sociological theorists, such as Marx, Durkheim and Weber, is complemented by examination of key figures in the development of anthropological traditions of enquiry, such as Morgan, Boas, Malinowski, Mead, Levi-Strauss and others. The development of social thought leads into ANTH3402 Contemporary Social Thought.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit deals with key issues in media law: defamation, privacy, and open justice. The focus will be on primary sources of law: the case law and legislation which media law practitioners cite in court every day. The issues covered will be relevant to traditional news media organisations (eg the ABC) and the journalists they employ; the internet intermediaries (eg Google) which have disrupted traditional media; and your average punters who share defamatory or invasive content on social media. The focus will be on Australian law, but there will be some comparative consideration of the media laws of other jurisdictions. The content will be predominantly doctrinal and designed to prepare students for careers in media law practice in Australia. Students will consider, for example, practical aspects of pleading defamatory imputations in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, and the "legalling" undertaken by news organisations identifying defamation risks pre-publication.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit explores the visual representation and sensorial experience of Paris as the quintessential modern city. By engaging the unique built environment and museum collections of Paris, this study abroad unit contextualises art and architectural history through on-site learning and affords students the opportunity to investigate spatial and visual concepts through direct experience. Primarily, students examine how large-scale city planning reshaped the spaces and culture of Paris in the nineteenth century.  Students scrutinise how acts of ‘creative destruction' altered Paris after 1850 and analyse how art, literature and politics responded to these changes. The unit traces the transformation of urban spaces over time and also consider how the modern framework of the nineteenth century persists to the present day. The unit encourages students to research Parisian streets, spaces, and works of art through a variety of representational tools, making use of both on-site writing and drawing as well as online resources in order to understand how this icon of urban modernity has been reshaped and reimagined over the last two-hundred years.  Ultimately, the unit presents Paris as a site of living history and offers students the unique opportunity to learn about France's built environment and visual culture in situ.</ns1:description>

It examines the adequacy of proposed solutions to some of the perennial and most troublesome problems that theists (and atheists) who reflect on their beliefs from a philosophical perspective have had to face. Alternative concepts of deity (pantheism, deism and panentheism) are also examined. Readings are drawn from classical and contemporary sources in philosophy and philosophical theology. Areas of enquiry include arguments for and against the existence of God, the divine attributes, the problem of evil, miracles, mystical experience, the nature of religious faith, religious language, and immortality and the nature of the soul.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>High performance computing is an integral part of modern scientific and engineering research. Most physical systems are explored through simulation and modelling using high performance computing tools like parallel computers. This unit introduces students to the essential tools and techniques of high performance computing. The main objectives are to introduce students to different frameworks of parallel and distributed computing that they can use in their specific areas of interest. The students learn to program multi core processors using OpenMP, and clusters of personal computers using MPI. Students examine high performance computing case studies from different scientific disciplines and also work on individual or group projects to consolidate their learning.
MapReduce is a programming paradigm for processing large data sets on clusters of computers. The implementation of MapReduce through Spark and the distributed file system HDFS has become a widely used programming model for high performance computing in the last decade. This unit will also introduce students to this programming model through lectures and laboratory exercises.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The aim of this unit is to familiarise students with the principles of international aviation law and the incorporation of those principles into domestic Australian law. This is achieved through an examination of existing treaties and relevant legislation. Significant issues in international and national air law are also be examined. For example, in the last decade and increasingly in 2014, air law faces new demands, including increasing levels of compensation for passenger injury and death (in particular in light of the Malaysia Airlines crashes) and demands that the harm aviation emissions cause to the environment be addressed. In addition, the unit involves comparative analyses between aviation law in Australia and other jurisdictions, with a focus on the European Union and those in the Asia Pacific. The unit also examines in detail the private law/commercial aspects of aviation law including the sale and purchase of aircraft, aircraft charter and lease agreements, and aircraft finance.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Social Work Methods 1: Introduction to Psychosocial Theory</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Modern professional standards, the courts, society in general and clients specifically, demands that your practice be guided by theoretical frameworks that have developed legitimacy over many years of research and clinical practice. Doing what ‘feels right', being guided by ‘good intentions' and adopting an atheoretical position is professionally and legally unacceptable. 
SWSP5630 Social Work Methods 1:  Introduction to Psychosocial Theory is the first of four units specifically focussing upon social work methods. Each methods unit from 1-4 will build and expand upon the previous methods unit. The philosophical framework governing this unit is the biopsychosocial model, which consciously attempts to synergistically incorporate all of the significant dimensions in human existence in order to optimally conceptualise our understanding of the human condition in general and mental health specifically. 
This unit examines explanatory (explaining how and why, but does not necessarily inform you how to intervene) and practice (specific instruction on how to intervene) theoretical frameworks that assist social work understanding. Where possible evidenced base practice theories will be empathised. Social work is a profession that relies on the understanding that theory provides in order to first conceptualise a clinical presentation, formulate appropriate assessments and ultimately intervene in a case. The fundamentally important areas of trauma, loss and grief will also be examined in detail.
Introduction to Psychosocial Theory will assist students to appreciate the ways in which a range of explanatory and practice theories, clinical assessment and the relationship with your client combine to influence professional social work decision making. Clinical discussion will be used to examine appropriate social work assessment and intervention strategies in regards to case presentations and general psychosocial issues. To assist this process, complex case studies will be examined to optimally reinforce the application of theory and psychosocial assessment.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides students with a UWA-guided field excursion to a WA, national or international location to explore the geological relationships between tectonic setting, crustal architecture and the origin and temporal–spatial distribution of ore deposits. It aims to advance student knowledge and practical skills in field-based geoscience in mineralised terranes. The field excursion will be based on regional transects that include spectacular geological exposures and a wide range of mineral systems (e.g. gold, iron ore, base metals and critical minerals).  Field sites will explore a variety of tectonic elements including cratons, fold belts, magmatic complexes, and sedimentary basins, to consider the large-scale lithospheric controls on metal enrichment and explore common or contrasting factors in mineral system development. Temporal scales are location dependent.  Archean–Proterozoic terranes provide opportunity to investigate Early Earth processes and their interactions in the evolution of lithosphere, oceans, atmosphere and biosphere. Phanerozoic terranes provide opportunity to investigate younger tectonic settings preserved in the geological record and their Earth system interactions.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>True crime podcasts, criminal underworlds, serial killers, outlaw biker gangs, police corruption, dark tourism, environmental crime, indigenous massacre sites and celebrity criminals. This unit explores an alternative history of Australia's criminal underbelly. It looks at true-crime documentaries and ethical considerations surrounding it, the culture and customs of organised crime, the minds and traits of serial killers, media depictions of high-profile female crime suspects, the evolution of criminal profiling, the policing of the colonial frontier and marginalised groups, and Rottnest Island's secret history. It also considers how Australia packages, markets and exploits its criminal heritage – and what it chooses to include and what it ignores. Students will come away with an understanding of Australia's dark criminal history; how it has shaped modern institutional practice in criminology, law, criminal psychology, media and marketing; and what lessons have been learnt from the past and what have still to be learned.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores the role of the mass media in the operation of government and the conduct of politics. The media are correctly perceived to have great power in shaping public policy and moulding public attitudes on a wide range of issues. However, while the media's power is undeniable, one should not disregard the influence over the media of other actors, notably the government. The unit examines the interaction between the media and the government in affecting public opinion and policies. It analyses cases from Australia and overseas in order to provide students with a deeper understanding of how and why the media game is played.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit equips students with knowledge and skills necessary to understand economic policies used in international agricultural trade and management of price risk using commodity derivatives. The unit is taught in two modules. The first module introduces students to international agricultural trade by focusing on why trade occurs, trade theories with applications to agriculture, and public policies and government programs affecting agricultural trade. The second introduce students to the purpose, operation, and use of commodity futures contracts and options.
At the end of the unit, the students will have developed an appreciation and understanding of the economics principles that underpinning international trade policies, including (a) determinants of trade patterns between nations; (b) gains from international trade; (c) effects of international trade on an economy; (d) winners and losers from international trade policies; (e) main arguments for and against protectionism; and (f) process and implications of international economic integration. They will also understand (g) how to hedge price risk using futures and option contracts.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Australian Architecture in a Global Setting</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Australia is at once an ancient land under Indigenous custodianship, a vast island continent, an outpost of Empire, a ‘New World' country, and an archipelago of coastal cities punctuating ever-expanding suburban metropolises. How is Australia's architecture reflective (or not) of these conditions? In the more than 200 years since European settlement, colonial concepts of plantation and transformation, New World questions of identity and cultural influence, dominant Modernist ideals prizing simplicity and restraint, and layers of centre/periphery relationships have variously informed the ideas and approaches adopted by architects in the design and development of Australia's built environment. Moreover, as a consequence of its isolated, colonial (as well as postcolonial) and New World conditions, Australia's architecture has always been involved in and characterised by cultural exchange with ideas and practices from overseas, though the avenues of influence have changed over the generations. Similarly shaped have been the histories and critiques of architecture in Australia. 
This unit examines architectural thought and practice in Australia in relation to (1) historical background and historiographical context; (2) pertinent theoretical frameworks that illuminate the colonial/postcolonial underpinnings of architectural development in Australia; (3) evolving global and regional contexts and shifting international relations; and (4) current and emerging local and global ideas about and approaches to urbanism, sustainability, digitalisation and so on. Importantly, the unit questions the applicability of the term ‘Australian architecture' and, in turn, explores the historical, regional, intellectual and methodological variety and diversity of architecture across Australia. Students are encouraged to reflect critically on the ways in which they might think and act inventively, productively and ethically as architects operating in a global setting.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Ethics introduces candidates to fundamental concepts and professional skills that are developed throughout subsequent units and are essential for professional practice as a Chartered Accountant. Students are introduced to skills for professional reflection, essential for objectively evaluating their own practice and for continuous improvement, and to consider the Code of Ethics that informs all of the sub-disciplines of accounting. Students analyse an organisation and its business environment and examine how it creates value in the context of ethical decision making. They are encouraged to take a holistic view when analysing an organisation, going beyond the numbers and asking ‘why'. This holistic analysis provides the foundation from which to identify risks, evaluate alternatives and make sound recommendations. A key component of this unit is an interactive workshop where students collaborate to consider ethical issues and apply professional judgement to topical and authentic ‘what if' business scenarios.
In Risk and Technology, students analyse how businesses create and protect stakeholder value with a focus on risk management, data and technology. Students evaluate and respond to the benefits, risks and challenges organisations face arising from existing and emerging technologies, process automation and the use and application of data. Students will develop skills and knowledge in areas of technical practice including identifying, analysing and managing risk, computational thinking, analysis and reporting of data and emerging technologies. In real world case-study based activities and associated assessments, students will apply ethical considerations to risk management and technology and develop skills to communicate technical data to a variety of audiences. Chartered Accountants ANZ designed this unit in partnership with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS).</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Issues in Women's Health Across the Lifespan</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Determinants of our health include the social, economic and physical environments in which we live, and our individual characteristics and behaviours, especially our sex and gender. Whilst life expectancy is higher for women than men globally, many biological and social factors combine to create a lower quality of life for women.
 
This unit explores determinants of women's health across the lifespan: from conception, through childhood, into the reproductive years and beyond to healthy ageing and death. Students will consider how these factors inform health decision making by the individual, their health practitioner and the healthcare system. Students will identify barriers and enablers to good health decision making and consider how to utilise/address these as part of health promotion strategies at a local, national, and international level. 
In this unit, students will begin to develop their research reading, writing, and science communication skills through both written and video assessments. They will also begin to learn how to carry out effective peer review and to successfully work as a team.
This unit is the first of three core units in the Women's Health Minor.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an advanced course of study in a specialised area. In particular, the unit's subtitle is currently The Political Economy of Terrorism. 
What do we know about the roots and motivations of  extreme, violent groups, such as ISIS, the KKK, al-Qaeda, or the Lord's Resistance Army? This course explores modern-day terrorism as one form of large-scale organised violence from a theoretical and especially from an empirical perspective. First, we try to understand when and why terrorism has been successful to varying degrees. Second, we turn to the intimate relationship between terrorism and the media; exploring whether and how news coverage is likely so crucial for terror groups; and what this means for a free press. Third, we consider the role of religion in terror movements and radicalization. Fourth and final, we evaluate counterterrorism strategies, exploring a few successful and unsuccessful cases for which empirical evidence is available.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is the point of entry for students who are native or near-native speakers of German. It integrates speaking, reading and writing, aural comprehension, grammar and syntax with materials drawn from German literary, social and cultural history. Utilising methods from visual history and German cultural studies, and focusing on the analysis of historical images and the study as well as discussion of selected texts, students are introduced to central issues in twentieth-century German speaking societies (with a particular focus on 1900–1961). All classes are conducted in German only. The workshop focuses on further reading, understanding and discussion of German history, literature and culture through the study of films and texts. The unit leads to GRMN1406 German Studies 6.
Students gain an increased level of competency in all four macro skills—listening to, speaking, reading and writing German corresponding to proficiency Level B1 and upwards of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen). Students develop an increased awareness of inter cultural understanding and of language learning, as well as research skills and communication strategies and increased awareness of how languages work in general.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>There are three primary academic objectives of the unit:  (1) to provide experiential learning in a research group atmosphere. Students become part of the Centre for Evolutionary Biology (CEB) and bring their ideas to fruition through discussion with the members of the group and their mentor. They participate in fortnightly CEB meetings where established researchers present their data and answer questions from the group. The students see how science is a collegial and constructive process;  (2) to learn the generic skills of scientific thinking, hypothesis testing, data handling and scientific communication; and (3) to develop specialised knowledge of the practical considerations of research in their area of study—learning (but not limited to) techniques such as biometry, behavioural analysis, meta-analysis, quantitative/molecular genetics/genomics or comparative analyses. The areas of theory covered depend on the project but could include natural/sexual selection, sperm competition, immunity, sensory ecology, conservation biology and population/quantitative genetics. Projects that focus on a range of study organisms, including terrestrial, marine and freshwater vertebrate and invertebrate groups may be available for practical work.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, science, clinical and professional content will be presented longitudinally, built around the core clinical conditions and presentations. 
Students cover the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, anatomical pathology and pharmacology. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and the clinical skills of medical history-taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours and understanding of the patient perspective and of patient-centred care. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are introduced along with the opportunity to discuss the main issues in social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics. Students have opportunities to develop their information literacy skills as applied to medicine. Introduction to professional aspects of medical practice includes professional behaviours, medical law and ethics, leadership and teamwork, collaborative practice, educational theory and practice, diversity within medicine, and Aboriginal health.
Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the Workplace-based placements.
The content and pedagogy of this unit is designed to meet and deliver toward AMC standards and to meet the conversion requirement.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Women have played significant roles in all aspects of music throughout history. This unit explores women's musical activities in a wide variety of roles including composer, performer, patron, teacher, critic, and musical object and symbol. Students study gender ideologies in various historical times, geographic locations, and culturally diverse contexts, and examine their effect on the ways in which women have been able to participate in music. Study also takes into account how related constructions of identity (such as class, ethnicity and race) intersect with issues of gender and sexuality. Topics covered are drawn from different musical genres, historical periods and places, for example: representations of women in nineteenth-century opera; African American Blues Queens of the 1920s; the role of women in the anti-apartheid protest movement; and female performers in Chinese courts.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Following the first cross-disciplinary 'Groundings Studio', this unit offers an introduction to the design of objects from an architectural point of view. The studio specifically engages with the design and composition of objects in relation to their physical and social contexts, basic construction principles, and material properties. Project briefs are designed to develop students' conceptual and compositional abilities and contextual understanding, imparting the skills to communicate their ideas in a tangible form, predominantly through both two- and three-dimensional manual techniques.Together the Level One units work across the very broad and the very small scales, introducing an awareness of objects within contexts and learning the means of response to and representation of these designed relationships. 
The unit may entail metropolitan-based field trips to sites contingent on design studio briefs which vary from semester to semester.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In this unit students choose to specialise in either music performance or composition in order to consolidate essential musicianship, technical and repertory skills addressed in MUSC1341 Principal Studies 1 or MUSC2741 Practical Studies B. For performers, there is a particular emphasis on repertoire drawn from the literature of the student's principal instrument or voice. The focus is on further development of technical and performance skills, culminating in a performance of chosen repertoire appropriate to this foundational level of tertiary performance study and preparing students for the higher level of technical development required for the next unit in the sequence, MUSC2541 Principal Studies 3. For composers, the unit builds on essential musicianship and fundamental compositional technique. These skills are developed through short composition exercises based on examples from the repertoire. Students study and apply common compositional techniques found in composers' works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This prepares students for a study of higher level techniques introduced in the next unit in the sequence, MUSC2541 Principal Studies 3. This unit is a complementary unit in the Music Studies major (degree-specific major) in the Bachelor of Arts degree.</ns1:description>

It enhances practical skills for counselling in various settings in social work practice. Students learn appropriate consultative processes, to think and work with cultural sensitivity, the importance of critical reflection, and how to be accountable for the ethical decisions they make.
The aim of the unit is to assist students to explore subjects related to trauma, loss and grief. The unit develops and increases students' understanding of a range of the effective therapeutic and social work approaches and models they are likely to encounter in their profession. It develops an understanding of trauma- informed therapy and increases students' understanding of the importance of providing the most appropriate and best timed intervention to different clients in different contexts.  The unit will integrate evidence based frameworks to counselling process.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit centres on the relationship between body, mind and culture. At the core of the unit is the question of how culture shapes understandings and aspects of mind and body. The unit may focus on these issues from either a psychological anthropology perspective or a medical anthropology/sociology perspective. A psychological anthropology focus include looking at issues such as emotion, cognition, perception and dreaming from cross-cultural perspectives, and approaches considered may include psychoanalytic anthropology, ethnopsychology, cognitive anthropology and neuroanthropology. Where the unit is taught to a medical anthropology/sociology specialty the emphasis will be on considering the biomedical tradition from anthropological/sociological, and cross-cultural perspectives; issues such as Western conceptions of illness, healing, and the body, and whether contemporary Western biomedical interventions reinforce colonial or imperial power in the effort to promote global health.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit examines critical theories of identity and their relationships with the law. It covers feminist theories, theories of sexual and gender orientation and masculinities as well as theories of intersection, between race, gender and sexuality. The first part of the unit is a survey of approaches taken by general and legal theorists. The second part examines several areas of law and society from the perspective of these ideas. The areas may include: homicide (reforms to defences); law relating to the economic life of women (e.g. pay discrepancies and the 'glass ceiling'); reproductive technology laws; and internet regulation. The unit emphasises inquiry into ideas rather than the learning of legal doctrine. It extends written and oral communication skills with a focus on theoretical and analytical discourse. This is a seminar unit: face to face participation applies to all of the three hours per week and none of the classes are recorded.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Knowing Social Realities: Theoretical Foundations</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit considers epistemology in the social sciences or, simply, how we know what we know in the social sciences in general. It considers theories of knowledge. As such, epistemological questions are central in the social sciences, especially when evaluating differences among various schools of thought. Our traversal of this terrain considers some of the crucial questions in theory construction and validation in the social sciences from an epistemological perspective. Students consider questions such as how can underlying principles be discovered and validated? Can specific theories be proven and refuted? If so, what constitutes evidence for this? How commensurable are epistemological bases of various perspectives? Must we posit a reality outside cultural constructions to present interpretations and explanations? What sorts of epistemological assumptions support a stance of cultural relativism and what sorts deny that position? How does situated knowledge or tacit knowledge challenge claims for objectivity or relativism? What is the role of subjectivity in social analysis? What sorts of representational strategies best convey the epistemologies of others? Students address these questions through the works of Durkheimian sociology, Marxisms, Weberian sociology, interpretive anthropology, phenomenological anthropology, ethnomethodology, practice theory, Foucauldianism and feminism.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The Behavioural Ecology unit covers the broad area of behavioural ecology – how an animal's behaviour is adapted to its physical and social environment. The unit comprises five modules: (1) Foundations of Behavioural Ecology; (2) Sexual Selection; (3) Predator-prey interactions; (4) Perception and Signalling; and (5) Kinship, Conflict, Cooperation and Social Behaviour. The unit is taught by a team of lecturers who combine expertise in all of these areas. The unit integrates these themes within an evolutionary framework that explores the adaptive basis of behaviour, individual plasticity and the genetic basis of behaviour, ecological interactions governing social, sexual and antipredator behaviours, along with a strong mechanistic understanding of how perceptual systems work. This is a required unit for the Zoology major, but it should also be relevant to any student with interests in animal biology, ecology, evolutionary biology and natural history.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This is an introductory unit in aesthetics (the philosophy of art). It examines perennial problems in aesthetics from a philosophical perspective. Areas of enquiry vary and may include—What is art? What is the value of art? What do we learn from art? What is beauty? How important is a definition of art and the artists' intentions in understanding or appreciating a work of art? What is an aesthetic experience and how can aesthetic value be determined? Are there objective standards of taste? Can one person's judgement regarding works of art be better than another's? What should the role of an art critic be? Is so-called 'high' art more valuable than 'low' art? Is mass art 'art' and is it morally problematic? What is the relation between aesthetics and ethics? Why do we enjoy watching horror films and why do we emotionally react to works of fiction? What, if anything, is wrong with sentimentality? Special topics include—Is photography an art? Is architecture an art? How does music express emotion? The unit also looks at the aesthetic appreciation of nature. Readings are drawn from classical and contemporary sources but the unit is not an historical survey.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is both practical and thematic. In the practical component students are trained to use traditional methods to make an artefact selected from a past human culture. Hands-on tutorials teach students about the properties of stone, wood, clay, fibre and other materials that people have used to make artefacts. These artefacts show how people met challenges such as climate change and social unrest by using innovation to shape the world around them. In the thematic component we look at how archaeologists go about their work, examining 'big issues' such as identity and DNA, gender, cross-cultural contact, climate change, human use of symbols, technology and contemporary issues such as homelessness, graffiti and how war affects the world's cultural heritage treasures. We train students in global cultural awareness and appropriate ethical conduct when engaging in cross-cultural research.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The relationship between climate and vegetation has been highlighted for more than a century and botanical data such as pollen and spores are now widely used to infer past climatic parameters as well as ages and correlations of sedimentary successions. Palynology and paleobotanical data are used in a wide range of activities including energy exploration, carbon capture and storage, and characterization of aquifers. This unit focuses on main concepts related to palynology and paleobotany and introduces key groups of palynomorphs with stratigraphic significance at various taxonomic levels. Emphasis is placed on the development of practical skills in palynology including the application of palynofacies analysis and integration of palynological data with geological, geochemical and geophysical data in paleoenvironmental studies.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit considers debate on the global 'convergence' of employment relations practices across national boundaries. Globalisation has had a significant impact on national employment relations, causing changes to the role of the state, employers, unions, and to the subsequent status of workers. The unit discusses common global forces that have shaped employment relations (trade and relocation of work, corporate and workplace restructuring, ideological and policy transformation) and key features of employment relations systems in four regions: North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The evolution of employment relations and its current state in these regions is analysed taking into account conflict at the workplace and dispute resolution procedures, regulatory institutions, employee participation, and the role of unions and employers.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the underlying concepts and practice of environmental planning and management. The unit traces the emergence of environmental planning in Australian and international contexts, and critically reflects on the economic, social and regulatory forces shaping planning and management practice. Students are then introduced to the process of planning and strategies for environmental management. This includes an introduction to core concepts and techniques of environmental impact assessment (EIA), adaptive management, scenario planning, community based natural resource management and other models and methods of environmental management. Classes provide a conceptual and applied background from which students conduct independent research on a variety of topics concerning environmental planning and management.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Migration and Development</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Most of today's pressing global challenges are inextricably linked to particular population dynamics. Global health epidemics, climate-related disasters, poverty, inequality and exploitation, war and conflict, economic interdependencies, and cultural and socio-political difference are all shaped by, and have implications for, human migration.  This unit examines the fundamental relationship between migration and development. It has two main themes: 1) migration associated with labour and livelihoods on a global scale, 2) the growing prevalence of forced migration or population displacement in response to conflict and violence, environmental and climatic changes, and major development projects. 
Students analyse migration trends and associated policy dimensions, both internationally and internally (i.e. within nation states). They develop skills in assessing the impacts of skilled and unskilled labour migration schemes and streams on the dynamics of poverty, underdevelopment and inequality both within and between countries. Here we consider the drivers implications for origin/source community, migrant, and destinations, as well as the particular challenges faced by mobile and nomadic populations in securing their livelihoods through regular population movement.  
Students also explore the continuum of voluntary to forced migration. In examining different forms, and drivers, of contemporary population displacement, students develop knowledge and expertise from research, policy and practice regarding principles for responding to the growing challenge of population displacement globally.</ns1:description>

Students build on the conceptual knowledge and technical skills acquired in Level 2 and extend their specialisation in relation to broader environmental issues. While working intensively both in the studio and in the field, students will learn how to contextualize their emerging practice by examining the writing and artwork of a number of contemporary figures who engage with the environmental issues of our time. Students refine their work by participating in group critiques and class discussions. In preparation for the Semester 2 capstone unit, Advanced Major Project, students will continue to develop their independent work practices and take greater command of the direction of their art.This unit is open to students who have completed units across the Fine Arts major who wish to focus their work through an environmental lens.</ns1:description>

This Unit introduces students to the complexities of working within an ever changing global context.  In exploring the contemporary challenges faced in addressing inequality and developing sustainable solutions, a focus will be on the role of social workers as collaborators and change agents. Students will be equipped with the practical and analytical skills to engage critically with the material and be required to explore 'use of self' in an unfamiliar cultural context by way of a written assessment and group project/blogs.  As a group, students will gain first hand experience working with an International Non Government Organisation (INGO), transferring knowledge acquired in class to a practice setting (Nb: communication will be remote with no field education component).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the rise of China as a global power and its implications for the world. It first studies the historical evolution of China's foreign policy, in terms of basic patterns, issues, interests and leaderships/regimes. Secondly, the unit looks into China's very often complicated relations with other great powers and key international organisations. Thirdly, in order to achieve an integrated view of China's role in globalisation, the unit investigates the transnational relations at the civil society level. Fourthly, the unit critically discusses the theoretical debates over China's rise and China's challenges to fundamental interpretative paradigms. The main aim of this unit is to equip the students with the knowledge to understand China's role as a burgeoning superpower in the twenty-first century, and the resulting practical and theoretical challenges to the world and Australia.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit examines the nature of human motor skill including sensory inputs, central decision mechanisms and outputs. How this process is controlled to produce efficient and coordinated action is examined under both cognitive and dynamical systems approaches. The development of motor skill is also examined, with an emphasis on qualitative analysis of fundamental motor skills. The structuring of effective learning experiences is examined from a coaching, pedagogic and rehabilitation perspective. Laboratory classes allow an in-depth exploration of the key issues within motor learning and motor control and seek to maximise student understanding of the practical applications of the theoretical content within human movement settings.</ns1:description>

Part 1 consists of supervisor supported identification and critical reading of the literature relevant to the area of research, development of (1) a critical review of the literature; (2) a specific set of aims and hypotheses, and (3) a methodology. It also encompasses the 'active' component of the research project—the laboratory work, interviews, measurement, fieldwork etc. It is assessed formatively on the basis of the draft Introduction and Methods sections of the dissertation.
Parts 2, 3 and 4 are the application and iterative refinement of the plan developed in APHB4002 Research Design and Analysis Part 1 for analysis of data gathered from the experimental phase of the research project and development of an interpretative discussion of the findings. It is conducted under the guidance of the supervisor and with feedback provided in the final seminar presented in APHB4008 Scientific Communication Part 2. It culminates in the submission of the completed dissertation for evaluation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit examines the resolution of civil disputes in Western Australia and Australia, including disputes between citizens and governments. It focuses on the conduct of civil litigation in the Federal, Supreme, District and Magistrates Courts in their exercise of state and federal jurisdiction. Students should gain a working knowledge of the jurisdiction and power of the various courts. Students should also obtain a thorough understanding of the conduct of a civil litigation, with an emphasis on the rules of court governing each court. 
A key part of the Procedure unit is the development of practical skills.  Students will be required to prepare and submit draft court documents each week for discussion during tutorials.  Students will gain an understanding of when different court documents are necessary during the lifespan of a litigious matter, what purposes those documents serve, and what should be included in and excluded from documents filed with the court.
In terms of topics covered, this unit considers: alternatives to litigation; choice of jurisdiction; identification and joinder of proper parties and causes of action; commencement of proceedings; service of process; pleadings; discovery, interrogatories, and other interlocutory proceedings; case flow management principles; operation of the fast track lists; disposal of an action without trial; preparation and entry for trial; conduct of a trial, judgment, costs, enforcement of judgments; and appeals to Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, and the High Court of Australia.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>We live in an increasingly multi-cultural world where there are many ways of 'being human'. At the same time, all people share some experiences in common: all learn, share and communicate beliefs, create and maintain social relationships, adapt to their environments, and make a living through particular modes of production. This unit explores the world's rich diversity of human experience and practice, looking at cross-cultural examples of it in domains such as religion, identity, subsistence, social inequality and communication. It also considers the variety of ways that anthropologists conduct their research.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit encompasses three interrelated modules:
(1) Ethics in Forensic Science—this module covers the necessity for a professional ethical code, describes existing codes from various forensic societies, and describes ethical conflicts that can arise in the course of professional practice. The practical session covers a selection of case studies designed to provide students with the opportunity to discuss the ethical dilemmas involved in each and make suggestions on how they could be appropriately resolved.
(2) Research Methods in Forensic Science—these lectures focus on the relevance and application of the scientific method in modern forensic science, including formulating research questions, applying the appropriate research methodology, discussing the data (including through the use of statistics), and making recommendations based on the analysed results. The effective communication of research findings through scientific writing and oral presentations are also discussed. The practical exercises are designed to reinforce the scientific concepts being taught in the lectures and students are required to design and execute a strategy for analysing a forensic case study.
(3) Practical Applications of Forensic Science—industry professionals and research students deliver a series of lectures on the practical applications of a range of forensic disciplines, and contemporary issues are highlighted and discussed in detail.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. 
This unit provides students with the ability to design and undertake health research and thereby contribute to the future development of population health. It provides students with the knowledge, skills and values required to conduct scientific research. It is designed to develop enhanced observational skills, relevant practical research skills, lateral thinking and problem solving, literacy and communication skills, as well as professional responsibility and ethical conduct. It also develops and consolidates students' knowledge and skills acquired during undergraduate study, with particular emphasis on using those skills in a sustained and purposeful way in conducting independent research relevant to population health.
Honours students participate in original research by the conduct of a supervised research project, a presentation of research findings and preparation of a journal-style scientific manuscript. They also participate in the School of Population and Global Health seminar program. Specifically, students implement a research plan to investigate the research question developed in the unit, collect, manage and analyse their research data using appropriate methods, interpret the results and draw conclusions using published evidence and sound scientific arguments, present a research seminar, and prepare a manuscript. Students are required to attend at least 80 per cent of the school seminar program, or equivalent, with approval of the honours coordinators. Students maintain a reflective journal of these seminars and identify the key messages of each weekly seminar attended and any relevance to their research. They are encouraged to think laterally about what is relevant to their particular project.
Parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Empowering Communities Through Design</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit seeks to use design approaches and frameworks to address global issues (social, economic, environmental and political) by establishing the value of design to a broader audience. By focusing on an issue-based methodology to problem solving, community-centred approaches and the importance of learning from the past, this unit seeks to establish a best practice framework for understanding the field and the worth of design that serves all people.
Social-impact projects are those whose outcomes are measured not through a lens of profits and market adoption, but through changes in behaviour that ultimately benefit individuals and communities as a whole across a broad range of social domains. What sets most social-impact projects apart from more traditional consumer work is the extent to which they must work with a wide range of stakeholders including those traditionally without power and voice, the broad scope of social objectives being addressed and the rigour with which they must be measured for effectiveness. The requirement for assessing and then communicating results is mandatory in this field. In an effort to serve the entire spectrum of people in need – not simply those who can afford design services – it is essential to document results. Through design-based research students will critically analyse and evaluate a range of global issues, their constraints and their respective design strategies. Using design-based solutions, students will then formulate a guide that becomes a framework for others to build from, a foundation for future design approaches to global issues with the ultimate goal of empowering communities.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Ocean data are collected in the field or remotely through satellites, cover a range of spatial and temporal scales, contain errors specific to each measurement system and require specific data analysis techniques to extract information to address a particular issue. This unit, with a strong practical component, includes the application of different methods to analyse physical and biogeochemical data sets. It covers a range of data analysis topics, provides an opportunity to develop a strategy for problem solving, and reviews and consolidates laboratory efforts. Students learn to apply data analysis techniques to a variety of data types that include (1) time series measurements (such as at a mooring); (2) Lagrangian measurements (float or glider); (3) remotely sensed measurements, and (4) historical and archival data.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The aim of this unit is to familiarise students with the principles of international aviation law and the incorporation of those principles into domestic Australian law. This is achieved through an examination of existing treaties and relevant legislation. Significant issues in international and national air law are also be examined. For example, in the last decade and increasingly in 2014, air law faces new demands, including increasing levels of compensation for passenger injury and death (in particular in light of the Malaysia Airlines crashes) and demands that the harm aviation emissions cause to the environment be addressed. In addition, the unit involves comparative analyses between aviation law in Australia and other jurisdictions, with a focus on the European Union and those in the Asia Pacific. The unit also examines in detail the private law/commercial aspects of aviation law including the sale and purchase of aircraft, aircraft charter and lease agreements, and aircraft finance.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The overall purpose of the unit is to develop a demonstrable understanding of intermediate quantitative methods. Material and demonstrations are provided to help students acquire the competence to identify, evaluate and generate various research designs, specify relevant statistical analyses to test particular hypotheses, interpret the statistical results, and write key statements that capture the obtained effects. A substantial amount of the unit is devoted to the description of the principles associated with between-subjects and within-subjects designs which include more than one independent variable. Correspondingly, several statistical techniques are introduced to test hypotheses relevant to the test of the difference between three or more means. The distinction between main effects and interactions is covered within the ANOVA framework. Additionally, a significant amount of the unit is devoted to the description of the general linear model as reflected in the context of bivariate regression and multiple regression. A small percentage of the unit is devoted to non-parametric statistical techniques. Finally, issues relevant to ethics in research, the importance of effect size, and the conditions that facilitate causal inferences are also covered. Emphasis is placed on an applied understanding of quantitative methods as implemented in statistical software (e.g. jamovi).</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit introduces students to the study of comparative politics. It examines the ways in which political systems vary across the world, from ideas to institutional structures to policy outputs. The unit will first engage with the core features of political systems, both democratic and non-democratic. Elements covered include constitutions, executive government, legislatures and parliaments, federal and unitary systems, parties and electoral systems and the media. Why have countries evolved different approaches to government, and to what extent do these approaches conform to democratic principles? What impacts do political systems have on core policy areas such as health care, the environment and criminal justice? Are political institutions and cultures static?  Or is change possible? How does the Australian system compare? In addressing these questions, the unit seeks to engage with important contemporary debates and issues, such as the rise of populism, the role of money in politics and the capacity of political systems to deal with major crises.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit explores contemporary masculinities against the backdrop of the historical impact of feminism, nostalgic narratives of masculinity in 'crisis', the emergence of alternative masculinities, men's rights activism, concerns about men's health, and calls for male 'champions' or 'allies' of feminism. Students draw from feminist theory, queer theory, critical race theory, sociology and cultural studies – the main fields that comprise 'masculinity studies' – to explore the politics of spotlighting masculinity; changing cultural approaches to masculinity; and the intersectional power relations that structure a range of masculinities such as hegemonic or subordinated masculinities. Methodologically, the unit is an extended exploration of how to balance compassion and accountability in the task of supporting and advancing healthy gender relations that enable all human beings to thrive.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides students with the unique possibility to engage with art that is relevant to their lives today by exploring art of the twenty-first century. Particular focus is devoted to contemporary practice and thought about art that has formed within a technologically rich context. Attention is given to discourses surrounding artistic responses to the world today and to how particular ecological, political, social and technological concerns of the twenty-first century inform artistic practice. The unit provides essential tools for researching and recognising alternative art histories to identified dominant narratives. It incites an awareness of the key debates surrounding the intersection of art and the twenty-first century world. Students also develop the general ability to conduct independent research in novel areas and an ability to think creatively and clearly construct and express new ideas and arguments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In a 1996 trial, the defendant had a confirmed alibi, the victim failed to pick the defendant out in an identity parade, and the age of the defendant did not match with the description of the aggressor given by the victim. The only incriminating evidence against the defendant was a DNA sample found at the crime scene. Can science help us assessing a criminal case of this sort?
Can science detect fraudulent statements in tax declarations just by looking at the ciphers?
Can science detect whether it was an accident, or a person was pushed down?
This unit answers these questions and provides students with a foundation in forensic mathematics. The basic mathematics and physics needed for this unit will be developed inside the unit itself, hence no prerequisites are required. Several specific forensic topics will be covered, including ballistics (distinguishing accidental falls from criminal incidents), bloodstain analysis (reconstructing blood sources and movements of the suspects from the crime scene), shotgun pellet patterns (determining the distance of the weapon from the surface hit by the pellets), fingerprint analysis (distribution of the fingerprint classes amongst the population), DNA evidence (can we use the detection of DNA as the only incriminating evidence?), and fraud detection (using mathematics and statistics to assess the reliability of quantitative claims and declarations).
The theoretical studies are complemented with the analysis of real criminal cases, trials, and courts' decisions.
Students from all degrees are welcome to join this class. Mathematics Applications (High School ATAR subject) or equivalent is recommended.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides experienced professional guidance for students to apply their practical skills in conservation planning to an individual research project involving the adaptation of significant places to suit new uses. Student research begins by studying a range of adaptive reuse projects carried out on significant buildings in Western Australia, examining the key issues involved in this kind of conservation practice, and assessing their success in conserving significance and extending the useful life of these places. This is followed by a main research project, building on a subject place for which a conservation plan has been prepared in a previous unit, to propose an appropriate adaptive reuse strategy for that place, develop it to sketch-design stage for client and planning approval, and prepare an outline scope of work with preliminary estimates of cost.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>What does it mean to live within (and outside of) Australian social structures and systems? Is there any such thing as 'Australian society' and, if so, how do social scientists go about describing and analysing it? This unit examines the main theoretical perspectives that have been applied to studies of Australian social life. An important objective is to provide students with the conceptual tools required for developing a critical understanding of major characteristics of 'Australian society'. Particular attention is paid to issues relating to institutions like the family and education, as well as issues of belonging and community identity. Topics covered include Australian community studies, national identity and migration, gender relations, social inequality and stratification, and the rural versus urban divide. Historical and contemporary analyses of Australian society are complemented by a selection of thought-provoking ethnographic and documentary films.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the methodologies of art history through a close examination of texts that have played a significant role in shaping the discipline. It develops some of the themes of the preparatory Level 3 unit, VISA3330 Art Theory, but instead of examining the contexts of research on art, the unit aims to examine the practices of art historians. These include but are not limited to visual analysis, archival research, institutional critique and revisionism. It does this through critiquing a series of texts that have been significant in employing particular methodologies in art history, examining both these methodologies and the way they have been employed in constructing arguments.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is a final undergraduate Music Ensemble unit in a series of four and it focuses on developing advanced ensemble performance skills and synthesising ensemble concepts through an individually focused music ensemble project. Students develop performance skills in their chosen/approved ensemble to advanced levels of performance expertise [either in an ensemble related to MUSC1982 Music Ensemble 2, (e.g. Percussion Ensemble, Show Choir, Symphony Orchestra, Winthrop Singers, Wind Orchestra, etc.), or through the learning of new repertoire in the same ensemble, subject to audition as appropriate*]. All ensembles perform at least once in public during the semester, either in the University or the wider community. In addition, students design, implement and present an ensemble performance project related to their chosen/approved ensemble. In the project submission for assessment students should demonstrate they have played a key leadership role and be responsible for all significant aspects of the project. This unit is an elective unit in the Bachelor of Arts degree. It is also open to students enrolled in other degree pathways who have an interest in music.
* Availability of ensembles for the unit is subject to change. All ensembles may not run in every semester.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The adoption of writing by the Greeks and Romans was transformative of their own cultures and came to dominate them in fundamental ways. Our understanding of their civilisations and histories is overwhelmingly reliant on their written records, and on the processes of survival of these records—from inscriptions and speeches, to poems, narrative histories and philosophical investigations—up to the age of printing and beyond. This unit focuses on the technology of writing from its earliest beginnings in Mycenaean Linear B, through to the development of Greek and Roman alphabets, and the different materials used to preserve writing, such as stone, animal skin, metal and papyrus. The physical nature of books and libraries in the classical world is studied, with particular attention to the transition from roll to codex, the book format which remains the standard today. Finally, some attention is paid to the different forms of writing from antiquity to the beginning of printing, especially the emergence of minuscule in the eighth and ninth centuries.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, students develop their patient history taking, communication, professionalism, reflective practice and manual dexterity skills by engaging in experiential learning in the UWA Podiatry Clinic to provide care to low risk patients. Students also engage in simulated work place learning to develop their understanding and application of safe practice management by demonstrating skills in clinical record keeping, gaining consent, patient confidentiality, podiatric assisting and explaining relevant mandatory policies and protocols in podiatric practice. Students are exposed to the application of therapeutic management of podiatric patients here. Students also develop clinical assessment skills, diagnostic principles and are able to justify assessment techniques to diagnose foot and ankle conditions and implement evidence based conservative treatments, while applying the principles of infection prevention and control protocols. Students learn the application of biomechanical principles to orthotic therapy and fundamentals of clinical assessments and conservative care, to then learn how to design,develop and manufacture a custom made foot orthoses to support and treat patients with foot &amp; ankle pathologies with foot orthoses. 
Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the experiential work-place learning environments.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Income Taxation Law</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">6</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system. 
The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from CHIN2403 Chinese 3 and provides the foundation for further developing linguistic and cultural competency. The unit continues to develop the four linguistic skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and increases students' effective communication skills to meet routine practical and social demands that are relevant at tertiary level. Special emphasis is placed on consolidating and expanding students' knowledge in using the target language appropriately such as gaining the awareness of the cultural and social context of modern Chinese.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In the broad context of Artificial Intelligence a key feature of intelligent beings is their abilities for perceiving their surrounds and making rational decisions on how to act, for example, deciding on the next move on a board game. This unit extends the classical problem-solving focus of algorithmic design to autonomous decision making, through introducing the key fundamental concepts and principles of intelligent autonomous agents. We introduce ideas such as decision making, goal-directed behaviour, heuristic search, action selection, environment with uncertainties, performance (self-evaluation), expected return and learning. These concepts are explored and reinforced through practical designs and implementations of intelligent agents situated in environments such as game playing.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit covers the art historical debates over global modernism and the way that artists responded to colonialism and industrialism as it made its way from Europe to the rest of the world. It focuses on the disciplinary shift from European modernism to global, multiple modernisms that emerged out of situations of cultural contact and exchange. Today, modernism also describes a mode of art that engages with globalisation, with the big picture issues of economic and cultural convergence and collision. The unit develops the student's ability to recognise debates over the nature of modernism and discern their central contentions. It gives students a crucial grounding in a body of art historical knowledge that is necessary for understanding specialist units that follow in Level 3, in fields such as contemporary and new media arts where discourses often engage with and react to modernism.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The introduction of empirical databases and methodologies to the disciplines of Linguistics and Translation Studies has given rise to a rapidly growing discipline known as corpus-based translation studies. This theoretical and practical unit explores important concepts in Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Corpus-Based Translation Studies (CBTS). The methodology used in CL and CBTS entails the construction of translation databases, linguistic annotation of translation databases, quantitative exploration and qualitative analysis of translation corpora, which lie at the heart of the development of empirical translation research. Students develop useful analytical skills for the study of translational language and learn to apply relevant analytical frameworks in the study of translation such as translation stylistics, translation universal laws and norms. The insights gained into translational language help students to develop appropriate translation strategies in practical translation.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The aim of this unit is for students to gain a quantitative understanding of fluid behaviour, and be able to apply this knowledge to solve a wide range of engineering fluid mechanics problems. There is a range of learning activities in this unit, including lectures, problem-based tutorials, laboratory activities, the fluid mechanics photography competition, and optional ‘master classes' on everyday fluid phenomena (such as the fluid dynamics of sport, kitchen fluid mechanics, the automatic shut-off of a petrol pump and scaling relationships in the natural world). Topics covered include:
(1)	Equations of fluid motion applied to a control volume: Principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy applied to a fluid volume, key fluid properties including viscosity, surface tension and specific gravity.
(2)	Dimensional analysis and similitude: Using the Buckingham-pi theorem to determine the dimensionless parameters that govern fluid systems, using dimensional analysis to get order of magnitude solutions to complex problems, designing models of fluid systems.
(3)	Pipe flow: Evaluating the dissipation of mechanical energy in pipe flow due to friction and turbulence, predicting flow velocities, flowrates and pressures in pipes, use of pump curves to predict flowrates in pump-pipe systems;
(4)	Open-channel flow: Manning's equation for predicting the depth of uniform open-channel flow, using specific energy curves to predict changes in depth in rapidly-varied flows, quantifying the depth increase and energy dissipation across hydraulic jumps;
(5)	Equations of fluid motion in differential form: Principles of conservation of mass and momentum in differential form, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to determine profiles of velocity, shear stress and pressure in planar flows;
(6)  An introduction to key fluid mechanics phenomena including turbulence, boundary layers, drag and lift and waves</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Integrated Pest Management - Principles</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Pests are defined as organisms that damage human interests, especially in the production of food, feed and fibre.  Pests may have worse effects in agriculture for two broad reasons.  First, food, feed and fibre are mostly produced from domesticated species, which are selectively bred to maximize production (yield).  However, maximizing production increases susceptibility to pests.  Second, the production systems designed to maximize food, feed and fibre production from domesticated species may also be optimal for pest species too.  Integrated pest management (IPM) is a decision system used to limit the damage caused by pests, with an economic basis.  This unit considers the evolution of domesticated species and production systems, their geographic origins and spread around the world, their corresponding pests, the development of pest control methods (especially chemical pesticides), and the continued evolution of pests to resist various pest control methods (especially chemical pesticides).  The unit explores the development of IPM as pest control methods failed, due to pest resistance, with a focus on the economics underlying of pest management decisions.  Both short term and long term consequences of pest control methods are considered, as are different forms of production system.  Different scenarios with varying balance between costs and benefits of production and susceptibility, pest control methods and pest resistance are considered.  The development of biological control is explored.  This unit aims to provide a clear understanding of the knowledge required to produce an IPM plan, including economics of production and pest control, methods to measure damage, compare utility of different pest control methods, and consider unintended consequences of each.  Examples of differing severity of pests, and pest control methods, from a wide range of plant and animal production systems in Australia and around the world.  This unit is relevant to students with interests in production systems, food security, natural resource management, environmental risk assessment, and environmental/ecological modelling.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Near Future Scenarios for a New Architectural Era</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>How is the future of architecture? If there is a common denominator characterising the contemporary world, it has to do with change and transience. We are surfing the waves of a society in constant change with increasingly unpredictable consequences. The time of post-modernism is a time without certainties while, as inhabitants of transitory society, it seems we are deprived of even the means to forecast the future. In the absence of certainties, individuals, and particularly designers, are required to connect episodic, short-term projects in new, meaningful ways. This fragmented way of living and designing requires considerable adaptability and flexibility. Accordingly, it is necessary to ask how the architect can work with this context of transience and uncertainty. In other words: Is there potentially new opportunity in the instability and constant change of evolving urban, social and economic contexts? If so (and it seems to be the case), how can the architect adapt and acquire new ways of thinking and designing in order to work with uncertainty?  Students will engage the techniques of popular culture to imagine and visualize near future worlds. Using data visualization, mapping, and collage, students are encouraged to develop their own unique body of work about the emerging conditions of the twenty-first century.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>High performance computing is an integral part of modern scientific and engineering research. Most physical systems are explored through simulation and modelling using high performance computing tools like parallel computers. This unit introduces students to the essential tools and techniques of high performance computing. The main objectives are to introduce students to different frameworks of parallel and distributed computing that they can use in their specific areas of interest. The students learn to program multi core processors using OpenMP, and clusters of personal computers using MPI. Students examine high performance computing case studies from different scientific disciplines and also work on individual or group projects to consolidate their learning.
MapReduce is a programming paradigm for processing large data sets on clusters of computers. The implementation of MapReduce through Spark and the distributed file system HDFS has become a widely used programming model for high performance computing in the last decade. This unit will also introduce students to this programming model through lectures and laboratory exercises.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This honours unit is compulsory for students of French Studies, German Studies and Italian Studies who are commencing their dissertation. It is also the co-requisite for TRNS5020 Translation Studies Dissertation 1 for selected students in the Master of Translation Studies. It is taught by the honours coordinator for European Languages and Studies and takes the form of a seminar.
Some of the seminar sessions examine major aspects of developing a research project (in this case, the honours or masters dissertation): formulating a research question in relation to existing knowledge; developing a formal research proposal; writing a literature review; structuring the dissertation; and advanced academic style. 
Students have the opportunity early in the semester to receive feedback on their draft research proposal from their peers in a supportive environment. Later in the semester they workshop their draft literature review. Students who undertook this unit during the previous semester and are completing their dissertations this semester join the group from time to time and both give feedback to current students on their research proposal and literature review drafts and have the opportunity to have a chapter draft workshopped by the group. Current students benefit from the experience and insights of students one semester further along in the dissertation writing process.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit analyses the way animal populations fluctuate and use resources in space and time. It considers how individuals within populations interact with each other and with individuals in populations of other species, including those interactions that contribute to the determination of the biodiversity apparent in communities today. It covers population parameters such as age structure, birth and death rates and how these are used to construct life tables and population models. Theories and empirical evidence as to how biodiversity has developed over time and is currently maintained are considered along with discussion of how biodiversity contributes to ecosystem function and how that biodiversity should be managed and conserved.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Engineers use their technical and social skills to benefit society. This unit introduces professional engineering practice and develops foundations for the learning and practise of engineering. The unit supports students to make the transition into first year and become student engineers who have the foundation skills for engineering studies and practice, and understand how they can use these skills to contribute to society.
In the unit, students work on a semester-long engineering design project and smaller design challenges, selected to facilitate achievement and demonstration of the learning outcomes. 
After completing the unit, engineering students should understand the relevance of their studies to their future careers. They should also have established important skills and expectations for learning and practice in engineering at university and professionally, particularly around communication skills, use of technical and non-technical information, inclusive teamwork, self-directed learning, and employing engineering design processes to address open-ended problems, all while adhering to values that earn the confidence of the community.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on field-based assessment of land and water resources. It is a more advanced treatment of soil mapping, land use and catchment hydrology. The unit brings students to a professional level of knowledge and skills assessing land use and land capability. The field sites are chosen to have various constraints and land use changes. The unit addresses different land uses in fluvial, agricultural and mining landscapes and its influences on soils and water. This is integrated with the assessment of soils and land use to provide sustainable land use management. Students acquire skills in soil and land capability mapping at a professional level so that they can independently assess soil resources; and hydrological assessment of land with field methods, probing soil hydraulic properties, infiltration capacity, susceptibility of runoff and erosion. There are three different field trips in the surroundings of the Perth landscape where students describe and sample soils in the field. Subsequent laboratory analysis generates data that is used for the final reports of the three field trips.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In this 'hands-on' unit, students undertake a guided historical project, including planning, research, and communication in a range of modes for different audiences. In seminars and workshops students become familiar with some of the key practical and theoretical issues and debates relating to the use of various historical sources, including photographs and film, archives, oral history and material culture. Strategies and tools for planning and managing research are workshopped, and students will be given the opportunity to work on a project in consultation with an external organisation. Some workshops may be held off-campus, and there will be a final event at which students' project work will be presented and celebrated. The skills in finding, analysing and managing information that are developed in the unit are required for advanced-level historical research, but are also highly transferable to many workplace situations. The unit is the culminating experience of the History major and is also recommended for students planning to proceed to honours in historical archaeology.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>In this unit, pre-service teachers will be introduced to child development and learning theory. Pre-service teachers will build their knowledge and understanding of the characteristics of children, and their physical, social and intellectual development. They will explore research into how students in the early to middle childhood phases of development learn, children's expected development trajectories, factors and circumstances that might impact a child's specific learning needs, potential challenges to learning, and the implications of these for teaching. Pre-service teachers will engage with the principles of effective teaching, key instructional approaches, connect theory to practice to design rich learning experiences, and will explore a range of teaching strategies and resources to support learning goals. Finally, pre-service teachers will think critically about how lesson plan structure and instructional approaches affect how children in the primary years engage in the learning process and acquire new knowledge and understanding.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers the years between the Homeric epics and the end of the Persian Wars, the period which shaped the main features of the Classical Greek world. Issues of social, literary, political, military and intellectual history and historiography are explored. The unit highlights social and political developments such as the phenomenon of tyranny and the evolution of oligarchy and democracy. The unit also explores the emergence of Persia as a world power and investigates how the confrontation between Persia and the city-states of mainland Greece entrenched Sparta as the major military power of Greece and gave Athens the naval power for her future development. The unit concludes with an exploration of pre-classical Greek intellectual culture.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit presents a macroscopic treatment of thermodynamics from an engineering perspective, beginning with definitions of properties, forms of energy and systems.  The behaviour of ideal gases is discussed, along with the use of the compressibility factor.  The 1st law of thermodynamics is applied to both open and closed systems, leading to the steady flow energy equation and the definition of enthalpy.  The behaviour of liquid-vapour systems and use of property tables and charts are discussed.  The 2nd law of thermodynamics, the property entropy, and the Carnot cycle are introduced.  The 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics are then applied to typical thermodynamic systems, for example internal combustion engines, using models such as the Otto cycle, Diesel cycle, and Brayton cycle.  Issues surrounding the use of such thermodynamic systems, for example fuel sources, thermal efficiency, pollution and emissions form part of this system analysis.</ns1:description>

The goal of the unit is for students to appreciate that the law operates in myriad ways, does not exist in isolation from the rest of society (but impacts on and changes in response to it), and is not perfect. The unit extends the written and oral communication skills developed at Level 1 and also engages collaborative working skills.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This practicum unit focuses on pre-operative patient management and surgical planning based on clinical findings. During the practicum students will provide mentorship to general podiatry students as they attend surgical clinics as part of their training.  Students are expected to attend hospitals and assist primary surgeons as well as perform basic surgical skills such as wart curettage, ingrown nail procedures, incision planning, soft tissue dissecting, wound closure and introduction to osseous procedures.  In additions, students will develop their communication skills through various methods such as oral case presentations to their peers, reflective logbooks, written assignments as well as patient interaction and communication with various healthcare professionals. This unit continues to build on the therapeutic concepts taught in the foundations units of the course and aims to expose students to various clinical scenarios where therapeutic management is safely implemented.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit enables students to critically evaluate conservation and development policy at the international and national scale from a range of intellectual standpoints with particular emphasis upon the framework of sustainability. Through a combination of lectures, lectorial discussions, case study analyses and interactive learning sessions, students are exposed to contrasting interpretations and experiences of policies designed to manage, conserve and develop natural resources. These encompass the 'fortress approach' to conservation which favours biodiversity preservation through enforcement, the 'participatory' approach espoused by many practitioners and NGOs which emphasises conservation through sustainable resource usage and the neoliberal approach to conservation which views resource management as an outcome of economic valuation processes. Students are encouraged to critique these approaches using case studies reflecting a variety of political, sociocultural, economic and physical contexts. Through studying the unit, students gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of competing conservation discourses and practices and their impacts from the perspectives of different stakeholder groups.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Effective marketing is not about learning a series of facts, but comes from systematic critical thinking and reasoned application of underlying marketing principles in a dynamic competitive environment. This unit provides the principles and analytical frameworks used in marketing and challenges students to use these to make better marketing decisions.
Emphasis is placed on developing the approaches and skills necessary to (1) assess marketing opportunities by analysing customers, competitors, company performance and the broader environment; and (2) design effective marketing approaches by choosing and applying appropriate strategies for pricing, promotion, distribution and products.
The unit explains marketing's role and its relationship with business strategy and makes a case for a market orientation in strategy formulation. It is focused on identifying, analysing and solving marketing problems and students are provided with opportunities to present and defend their own analysis and recommendations through a series of case studies. Lectures, cases and classroom discussion are used to build knowledge of these marketing issues.
Marketing in both business-to-business and consumer markets is addressed. There is recognition within the unit that environmental changes, customer needs and shifts in competitor activities all impact on appropriate strategic and tactical marketing choices.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>The United States is a nation born of revolutionary struggle against an imperial power, yet its core concept of human emancipation was founded upon the enslavement of Africans and the expropriation of native people's lands. This unit examines these deep, shifting and persistence contradictions, from the US–Mexico War to the present day. It is a social and cultural history of the nation and its diverse peoples, with special emphasis on the interaction of everyday life, high politics and evolving political economies. Students gain specific knowledge of American history by analysing its social movements, political transformations, foreign policies and the effects of economic change. At the same time, they gain an understanding of basic issues in the historiography of the United States.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit and its corequisite APHB5516 Honours Dissertation Part 3 at Level 5, can be teamed with APHB4004 Honours Dissertation Part 1 and APHB4005 Honours Dissertation Part 2, to provide an alternative, higher level dissertation.
Part 1 consists of supervisor-supported identification and critical reading of the literature relevant to the area of research. It develops development a critical review of the literature, a specific set of aims and hypotheses, and a methodology. Part 1 also encompasses the 'active' component of the research project–the laboratory work, interviews, measurement, field work, etc. It is assessed formatively on the basis of the draft Introduction and Methods sections of the dissertation.
Parts 2, 3 and 4 are the application and iterative refinement of the plan developed in unit APHB4002 Research Design and Analysis for analysis of data gathered from the experimental phase of the research project and development of an interpretative discussion of the findings. It is conducted under the guidance of the supervisor and with feedback provided in the final seminar presented in the unit APHB4008 Scientific Communication. It culminates in the submission of the completed dissertation for evaluation.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Rome</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Rome has always played a pivotal role in European culture and beyond. First as the centre of the Roman Empire, then as the seat of the Catholic church, the Eternal City attracted centuries of patronage and artistic production on an unrivalled scale. Numerous layers of evidence provide an unequalled historic kaleidoscope—from the ruins of classical Rome, its Renaissance and Baroque churches and palaces, to the late nineteenth century historicist monuments or the grand plans for a new Rome partially implemented under Mussolini's fascist regime. This unit provides students with the opportunity of gaining an on-site overview of Roman art and architecture from classical antiquity to the present day. One key theme of the unit therefore is the importance of physical context on the creation and viewing of works of art. Another key aspect is the interplay of different layers of art and architecture. To what extent, for example, is our perception of Rome's classical past shaped by the drastic interventions of fascist urban planning? Students are given the opportunity to explore and move between different archaeological layers, to critically consider issues faced by the demands of conserving artistic heritage in a major European tourism destination and to research on a range of art works and sites from classical antiquity to the twenty-first century as they explore to what extent Rome continues to be a cultural and political symbol, as much as a city.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit deals with data modelling through the theory and practice of database design, implementation and use. Several database models are addressed, with a strong focus on the relational model and its theoretical grounding in sets and relational algebra. The process of problem decomposition into entity-relations, the design of appropriate relational schemas, and their refinement through normalisation underlies the unit. Critical issues surrounding the design of query languages and their implementation are addressed, and information retrieval is practised using a specific query language. Students learn database connectivity by building systems in one of several programming languages that support a connectivity Application Programming Interface (API).</ns1:description>

Business Communication for Change, Influence and Impact explores how communication in the workplace helps individuals and organisations promote and respond to change, influencing and motivating others in order to have a sustained and meaningful impact. 
This unit examines the fundamental role communication strategies play in determining personal and organisational success. Consequently, students will work individually and collaboratively to apply contemporary communication theories and strategies to real-world challenges faced by companies and organisations in the 21st century. They will learn to apply the principles of ethical research, critical and creative thinking, and effective professional written, verbal and visual communication skills by producing a crisis communication strategy report and presentation. The unit will also establish a personal framework of reflective practice and goal-setting in order to build self-efficacy and accountability, enhancing the necessary skills and resilience essential to professionals facing a rapidly evolving and unpredictable future.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Issues in Japanese Society and Culture</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit moves beyond popular stereotypes and essentialist understanding of Japan to provide students with a critical understanding of the sociocultural processes underpinning the emergence of that nation as a major global industrial power in the second half of the twentieth century, as well as an appreciation of the dynamics of contemporary twenty-first-century Japanese society. In particular, the unit complements the Japanese language units on offer by reinforcing students' appreciation of the sociocultural context within which the language operates. Using a multidisciplinary approach and with reference to both academic and popular culture texts and resources, the unit draws attention to the complex interplay between discourses, institutions and practices of work, family, culture, nation/citizenship and gender and sexuality in the day-to-day dynamics of Japanese society. These issues are examined both with reference to domestic Japanese society and in relation to the broader Asia–Pacific context. 
The first half of the unit provides a framework for understanding Japan's sociocultural and economic transformations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, both with reference to domestic society and in relation to the wider Asia–Pacific region. The second half of the unit focuses on specific 'case studies' and discussion topics including: (1) Japan in relation to research debates on sociocultural change; (2) changing discourses of identity and nation; (3) popular culture and urban consumer culture; (4) shifting discourses of gender and sexuality; and (5) changing attitudes to work and corporate culture.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides an introduction to the study of Asia which is of benefit to students undertaking any degree program and to provide students taking Asian language studies and higher level Asian Studies units/major with a firm foundation of knowledge necessary for higher level studies of the Asian region. These objectives are achieved by having students examine the foundations and traditions of modern societies in Asia and by exploring themes and issues such as traditional social and economic structures as well as traditional systems of belief and philosophy. A further and important academic objective is to address the discipline's evolution and place in academia as part of the discussion of how Asia is given meaning as a field of academic study. Students are equipped to describe and evaluate the various meanings and representations of Asia and critique the way in which Asia as an 'entity' and idea has been 'constructed' both internally and externally. Students who take this as a broadening unit are equipped with a higher level of cultural competence and global awareness. Central themes of the unit highlight the interconnected yet culturally diverse nature of the world in which we live.</ns1:description>

Normal anatomy of the foot, ankle and lower extremity is discussed in detail. In addition, students learn about the biomechanics of the foot, ankle, lower extremity and selected common podiatric pathologies. Students are introduced to foot and ankle radiology and learn how to correlate X-ray findings with biomechanical parameters. During the laboratory sessions students are taught the principles of taking a history and a podiatric physical examination. The practitioner-patient relationship, record keeping and time management skills are introduced. An introduction to neurological and vascular examination of the lower limb is undertaken.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Over recent decades there has been growth in government and an increasing diversification and complexity in government service provision. There has also been, for the most part, a concomitant rise in the number (and reach) of accountability agencies, so much so that some commentators now talk of the emergence of a fourth branch of government, the ‘integrity branch', to sit alongside of the executive, legislature and judiciary. These accountability agencies have responsibility for overseeing, investigating and educating the public sector in relation to matters such as corruption, misconduct, good decision making, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Such agencies play a vital role. Governments make decisions on a daily basis that directly shape many aspects of individual and corporate existence. With such regulation comes the need for transparency, responsibility and accountability. In the words of former Commonwealth Ombudsman Professor John McMillan, "In short, the power of government is pervasive, and accountability is an indispensable check on how that power is exercised."</ns1:description>

The values and ethics underpin all elements of social work practice and learning and include the necessary accountabilities expected of practitioners. This unit will allow students to explore and reflect on their own values, interpersonal skills as well as beginning to integrate social work values into their own emerging social work identity. Aspects of social work supervision will also be explored. Students will learn about the importance of reflective practice, effective communication and the responsibilities of professional social workers in a range of organisational contexts.  Students will commence a reflective journal which they will continue throughout their 4 years of study in the BSW and will feed into the development of a practice framework to be presented in the intensive unit at the end of the final year.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the overall practice of landscape architecture in the workplace. It enables students to develop some familiarity with the day-to-day procedures of professional practice, and to gain a basic understanding of the operational context of practice. To this end, the unit spends some time establishing a fundamental understanding of how offices are organised and run, and how projects are procured and managed including procedures for bidding, contract formulation, documentation and administration through to project completion. The roles and responsibilities of the professional bodies responsible for and affiliated with the practice of landscape architecture are presented. This unit is run in conjunction with LACH4414 Landscape Professional Documents which provides greater detail in the preparation of landscape professional documents including documentation plans, typical construction details and written technical specifications associated with the tender and construction of landscape works. The weekly structure of the unit is based around the ALVA Mentor Scheme. In this scheme, in which a wide range of practices in Perth participate, small student groups are assigned to a 'mentor' practice, and usually to an individual in that practice. Students meet with their mentors regularly throughout the semester to further investigate a schedule of structured topics presented in class via lectures, seminars and workshops. For example, typical office employment procedures are outlined in class, and students then investigate, document and present back to class the specific practices employed by their mentor and their respective office. Assignments are designed to develop teamwork and awareness of team management issues both within an office context and across the disciplines that make up typical project teams. Particular examples are worked through involving the interface between, for example, the landscape architect, the planner, the architect and the engineering team.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Decision Strategies for Biodiversity Conservation</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>As the world population grows, so to does the pressure on the world's biodiversity. In an ideal world, there would be sufficient funding and resources to conserve all species but the reality is that the list of species at risk of imminent extinction is growing faster than our ability to conserve them. It is crucial that decisions made for biodiversity conservation are evidence-based and recommend actions that are cost-effective. ‘Decision Strategies for Biodiversity Conservation' focuses on the legislation, principles and practices underpinning effective decision making for the conservation of biodiversity and how these might, or might not, translate into practical on-the-ground benefits for ecosystems and their biodiversity. Students will consider the role of scientists in addressing decision-making for biodiversity conservation and engaging with the end-user of the research. Students explore the real issues that face managers and policy-makers when trying to weigh up the costs and benefits of conservation actions when there are multiple stakeholders and priorities at stake. Students learn about the principals of decision-making for biodiversity conservation, case studies of the application of tools to assist decision-makers, and some of the barriers to implementation of recommendations into on-ground action.. Students will hear from scientists, policy-makers and other Government authorities, and peak body representatives. Students will gain an insight into the world of biodiversity conservation enabling them to make future conservation decisions that are more likely to have successful outcomes</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is taken over two successive semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. The unit is a component of the Anthropology specialisation of the Master of Forensic Science by coursework and dissertation (51520). It is designed to provide students with practical experience in independent scientific study through the completion of a literature-based project of direct relevance to forensic anthropology. Students develop scientific writing skills by compiling a substantial scholarly dissertation on their research topic. The dissertation must be analytical but it is not essential that the student collects the original data, therefore the following strategies may be employed: (1) experimental design; (2) statistical treatment of data from other studies; (3) a compilation of information from other studies; (4) meta-analytical procedures; or (5) profiling of case studies.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit covers the broad spectrum of professional documentation required for tender purposes in a contemporary landscape architecture practice. Topics covered include workflow practices, tender/construction documents, specifications, construction contracts and standards, and bills of quantities. The unit consists of the partial documentation of a suitable site, interwoven with a series of lectures and practical exercises in which students progressively prepare the technical documents for this space. Standard tutorials and lectures are supported with guest lectures, site visits and visits to professional offices to expose students to the breadth and scope of works associated with preparation of a technical set of documents. The final part of the unit is the culmination of the documents as a professional tender/construction set, complete with bill of quantities and letter to tenderers.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit moves beyond the fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to explore in greater depth and breadth, many of the concepts introduced in ENVT4411 Geographic Information Systems Applications (or similar). The unit introduces students to spatial data and analytic techniques of particular relevance to the environmental sciences. ENVT5562 explores contemporary approaches for the presentation, manipulation and analysis of spatial information informed by industry practice and issues related to coastal systems and their resilience. Key topics include spatial abstraction, multivariate analysis, spatial data exploration and statistics. Throughout the unit students undertake critical assessments of spatial analytic strategies used by government agencies, the private sector and academia to support the resilience of our coastal systems.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Digital advocacy is one of the powerful approaches employed by civil society, governmental institutions, political movements and NGOs to galvanize support for influencing desired change. Digital advocacy engages with contemporary issues of power, inequality and injustice, offering strategies for social and political change that are able shape new ethical terrain for our public cultures and social worlds. In contemporary culture, digital technologies have come to play an essential role in mobilizing people around various issues and causes, opening unprecedented opportunities to advocate on a range of concerns such as social justice, inclusion and equality, public health and environmentalism, to the responsible progress of science and technology and the courses of international development. 
This unit introduces students to the fundamental principles and practices of digital advocacy, combining classroom, media lab and experiential learning activities to equip students with the applicable knowledge and skills essential for designing an informed, impactful and ethically engaged digital advocacy project. Assessment is based around project work to put the theoretical and skills learning into practice.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit presents an overview of the evolution of career development theory in a social, economic and historical context and provides a tool kit of practical applications for developing the workforce and developing an individual career. Students will learn how to identify and assess the impact of local and global social, economic, political and technological changes and factors, forces and trends influencing the workplace and career related options and choices, together with individual, social, organisational and other influences on career related choices, transitions and labour market participation.
Recent literature has identified the need for professionals and leaders to acquire knowledge in the areas of self-management and the management of others to contribute to organisational performance. This unit develops personal, interpersonal and organisational skills that distinguish outstanding people managers and industry leaders.  Being a successful manager requires more than content knowledge and technical skill. Through industry engagement and practical activities, this unit provides a unique opportunity for students to develop their own career development plan, as well as to investigate organisational best practice in enhancing the employability of the workforce.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>The Northern Renaissance</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">3</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In the early fifteenth century, art produced in the Burgundian Netherlands (an area consisting of present-day Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France) was celebrated and exported as far afield as Italy and Spain. The introduction of oil paint had given rise to a revolutionary style of painting, allowing artists like Jan van Eyck to create seemingly hyper-realistic representations that reflected new interests in the depiction of nature and human emotion. This unit charts principal developments of the so-called Northern Renaissance, from its origins in court art of the Burgundian Netherlands around 1400, its dominance over the European market for much of the fifteenth century up until the increasing engagement of sixteenth-century artists like Albrecht Dürer with developments in contemporary Italian art. Students are introduced to the visual language of the period and the ways in which figures like Hieronymus Bosch subverted traditional iconographies. Key themes include the use of art in religious ceremony, the rise of new artistic genres, changes in art patronage and the art market, and the emerging awareness of national styles and their historiographies. While special emphasis is placed on painted works, the unit also considers other art forms such as manuscript illumination, carved wooden altarpieces, tapestries and stained glass.</ns1:description>

The unit subsequently explores subsystems within the context of Earth's surface environment, for example, how plate tectonics interact with climate, sea level, landmasses and the biosphere. Investigations at both global and local scales emphasise how these subsystems are linked and how humans interact with, and are influenced by, these Earth processes. An understanding of dynamic Earth processes allows an informed evaluation of environmental issues that affect society and the biosphere at all levels.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit focuses on the design of offshore structures and moored vessels. 
The first part of the unit explores the estimation of the loads and responses of offshore structures due to waves, winds and currents. To form these estimates a range of models, including classical linear potential flow models and non-linear models are introduced.
The second part of the unit presents an introduction to response-based analysis, which enables estimates of the load and/or responses of an offshore structure at a given design return period by taking into account the joint occurrence of wave, wind and currents. 
Case studies are presented for a range of offshore applications, such as oil &amp; gas platforms, wind turbines, wave energy converters, floating solar, hydrogen and aquaculture.
The unit also provides examples of numerical modelling, experimental data and field data, describing how each may be used to inform offshore engineering design.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Active citizenship is becoming increasingly important around the world in the context of complex and unpredictable problems and systems. There are also many different options available to us regarding how we might choose to act as responsible citizens through civic participation and social change.
This unit contextualises emergent approaches to active citizenship against a cross-cultural history of the concept. Through classroom discussion and drawing on practical experience, the unit explores local and global possibilities for the exercise of active citizenship, and invites and supports students to explore different pathways to being active citizens. Content areas include community connection and action, volunteering, donating, advocacy and governance, and social entrepreneurship.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit is delivered as a series of interactive workshops with an emphasis on developing science content knowledge, science pedagogy and improving students' attitudes towards science in early childhood settings and primary classrooms. Emphasis is placed on inquiry learning, utilising a 'hands-on, minds-on' approach to engage children. The role of evidence in science is discussed. The important place of prior knowledge in children's science learning is explored with an emphasis on the relationship between everyday concepts and scientific concepts. Students become familiar with the three curriculum strands: science understanding (biological sciences, chemical sciences, earth and space sciences, physical sciences); science inquiry skills; and science as a human endeavour of the Australian curriculum: science. Students also become familiar with the place of science within the Early Years Learning Framework. Students develop understanding of integrating mathematics with science. Students begin to develop a resource file and professional library as a means of developing their own science content knowledge.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Becoming a Leader: Perspectives on Leadership Development</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Developing leadership skills, competencies and potential is thought to traverse the entire lifespan. No longer is it considered state-of-the-art to take people away from their work to develop as leaders through programs, workshops, seminars or other episodic interventions. Rather, state-of-the-science approaches focus on using ongoing experiences as a way to foster and accelerate leadership development. This unit explores various experience based approaches to developing leaders and leadership. The unit is designed to foster interactions among participants in class as well as outside class. The instructional approach uses experiential exercises, case studies (video and written), projects and discussions to facilitate learning and personal development as leaders. Among the topics covered in the unit, specific attention is given to understanding various theories and models of change, how to enhance development and human and social capital, using assessment for development techniques, conceptualising and leveraging network perspectives on developing shared leadership capacity, and leading development of self and others at individual and collective levels.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit will provide an introduction to a range of perspectives and understandings that will help students work effectively with Indigenous students, youth and families within the Australian/Western Australian education system. The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and, in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Caravaggio and the Baroque</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">2</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>In Italian art of the seventeenth century, things are never quite as they seem. Caravaggio's highly naturalistic paintings merge biblical figures with local prostitutes and beggars; the sculptor Bernini turns hard marble into soft flesh and stillness into motion; Borromini's buildings appear to pulsate and envelope their visitors; and heaven and earth converge in vast ceiling paintings of palaces and churches. Besides such illusions, the Baroque revels in drama. Art no longer needs to be aesthetically pleasing - it can be ugly or horrific in its quest to provoke strong emotions. It is a period of innovation, producing the first feminist artist and the first global style. Yet it also is the first period fully aware of the history of art, bringing about changes in collecting and theorising art that reverberate into the nineteenth century. This unit examines Baroque art and architecture in the context of major historical developments, such as the Catholic Counter-Reformation and early colonialism. It also studies contemporary art theory through the prism of its arguable most iconic artist, the Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>GIS and Remote Sensing in a Changing World</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">4</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Technological advancements are promising new frontiers for data access, processing and analysis capabilities. Spatial location is key to understanding ecological processes, variability in models, and climate change refugia. This unit will introduce participants to geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Participants will explore GIS and remote sensing methods through real-world scenarios, exploring impactful applications, such as the use of timeseries satellite data in measuring climate change impacts, or blue carbon hotspots. Participants will use multispectral satellite data, and high resolution drone imagery to derive indicators of terrain, habitat condition and structure. Typical activities that participants will undertake include:Develop biomass assessments of mangroves and explore spatial variability in habitat condition from environmental indices derived from multispectral imagery, Develop structural and rugosity measurements for coral reefs from high resolution drone imagery and reflect how coral bleaching affects reef structure. 
After completion, participants will be better prepared to apply GIS and remote sensing to environmental monitoring scenarios. These skills can be integrated into various aspects of environmental analysis and impact assessments.</ns1:description>

It is designed to provide students with practical experience in independent scientific study through the completion of a literature-based project of direct relevance to forensic anthropology. Students develop scientific writing skills by compiling a substantial scholarly dissertation on their research topic. The dissertation must be analytical but it is not essential that the student collects the original data, therefore the following strategies may be employed: (1) experimental design; (2) statistical treatment of data from other studies; (3) a compilation of information from other studies; (4) meta-analytical procedures; or (5) profiling of case studies.</ns1:description>
    <ns1:outcome>demonstrate theoretical techniques related to the discipline of forensic anthropology and</ns1:outcome>
    <ns1:outcome>be acquainted with with current developments in basic forensic sciences, particularly those medical and social sciences which are of direct relevance to the application of forensic anthropology.</ns1:outcome>

    <ns1:description>Students will work as a language assistant in a primary or secondary school under the mentorship of a qualified teacher. Prior to the practicum they will participate in professional learning provided by the Department of Education (this will be delivered in an intensive format prior to the beginning of semester 1). The practicum will involve roles negotiated with the mentor teacher, for example facilitating group work, preparing/developing resources, one-to-one oral work. Students will create a language learning resource/activity in consultation with the mentor teacher. Over the course of the practicum, students will attend three online check-in sessions with the unit coordinator, at which they will report on the progress of their practicum and reflect on their workplace learning.
The academic objectives of the unit are to apply the practical skills and theoretical learning from their language major in this particular workplace setting and to identify and demonstrate transferable skills applicable to any workplace.
This unit is not available for self-enrolment and is only available to high-performing students. Students wishing to apply for the unit must contact the unit coordinator and submit an expression of interest (a form will be supplied for this purpose).
Note that  completion of this unit will not be deemed to contribute to pre-service practicum experience for the Master of Teaching or any other teaching qualification.</ns1:description>

Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. Part 1 consists of supervisor-supported identification and critical reading of the literature relevant to the area of research, development of (1) a critical review of the literature; (2) a specific set of aims and hypotheses; and (3) a methodology. It also encompasses the 'active' component of the research project—the laboratory work, interviews, measurement, field work, etc. It is assessed formatively on the basis of the draft introduction and methods sections of the dissertation. Parts 2, 3 and 4 are the application and iterative refinement of the plan developed in APHB4002 Research Design and Analysis for analysis of data gathered from the experimental phase of the research project and development of an interpretative discussion of the findings. It is conducted under the guidance of the supervisor and with feedback provided in the final seminar presented in the APHB4008 Scientific Communication.

    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">1</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>This unit is aimed at students assessed as being near native speakers of Korean in a placement test. The unit develops students' competency and linguistic skills by focusing on complex linguistic structures and expressions used in both spoken and written Korean and it further creates awareness of different forms and styles of written language. It fosters a deeper understanding of Korean culture and society through reading authentic Korean language materials contextualised within the students' social setting and connecting it to the students' background. Students are also required to reflect upon Korean contemporary social issues in written essays in Korean. 
Students are expected to achieve a high level of skill in writing in a range of different text typology using specific expressions and style. They are also expected to give formal presentations in Korean about issues related to Korean culture and society. By doing so, students reach not only a high level of proficiency in formal speech, and formal writing, but also a detailed knowledge of contemporary achievements and problems in present day Korea.
Students enrolled in KORE1405 will be asked to complete tasks at a more advanced level compared to those enrol in KORE3405, to reflect their actual language proficiency.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit provides students with a UWA-guided field excursion to a major sedimentary basin in Western Australia, Australia or overseas during which students gain experience in field-based data collection, analysis and interpretation of sedimentological, stratigraphic, structural and other relevant data.  Activities undertaken during the field excursion provide a major opportunity to examine paleo-environments and use sequence-stratigraphic concepts to establish key aspects of basin margin history.  The post-fieldwork report provides an opportunity to interpret student's own field data and synthesise both in graphical and written form. In addition, students have the opportunity to evaluate petroleum system development with emphasis on reservoir geometry, architecture, heterogeneity and reservoir quality.</ns1:description>

    <foaf:name>Programming for Business</foaf:name>
    <ns1:level rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer">5</ns1:level>
    <ns1:description>Today's businesses have an increasing need to make sense of the large quantities of structured and unstructured data that are generated. Understanding how to integrate large and complex data sets, and transform such data into meaningful insights and actions, is vital for business success. Business analysts equipped with basic programming skills will have greater awareness of the complexities of managing large data sets, the ability to converse with other technical experts (such as computer scientists), and the capacity to make meaning of the output given their business expertise. 
This unit is designed for students with little to no programming experience. Foundational programming concepts (such as variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions and procedures, and using libraries) will be taught and applied to business examples. Students will engage with general-purpose programming languages (such as Python) to write basic programs, integrate data sets, visualise, analyse and manage data.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>Archaeology constantly experiments with theory. methods and techniques. This unit examines the latest such experiments. Topics include: conducting experiments such as making stone tools, ceramics, metal and other artefacts. We explore technology such as drones, GPS, aerial mapping, photogrammetry, 3D printing and more. Visiting experts may hold intensive workshops on topical issues such as heritage management, gender, designing ethical, OHS and other fieldwork protocols, or creating an archaeological outreach programme. This unit never teaches the same content twice and constantly evolves with Archaeology as a discipline—and maybe even help lead the (re)volution.</ns1:description>

    <ns1:description>This unit follows on from INDO1402 Indonesian 2 or INDO1102 Indonesian Beginners II and leads to INDO2404 Indonesian 4. The main objective is for students to attain 'transactional proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 1+ of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). Students memorise model conversations based on routine activities such as visiting the doctor, looking for a house and being welcomed as a guest. They gain practical experience and confidence in speaking as well as learning about social conventions. Students' listening and comprehension skills are extended by studying extracts of authentic Indonesian films. They are also exposed to short articles taken from the Indonesian media in order to develop reading skills and vocabulary. Students are given a workshop on writing essays in Indonesian in order to learn some of the conventions of formal writing.</ns1:description>
